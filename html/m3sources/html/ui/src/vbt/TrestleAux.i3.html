</PRE> Controlling screens 

<P> The following two procedures allow clients to bypass Trestle and use the
   screens directly. For example, they can be used by the screensaver process
   to blank the screens if the workstation has been inactive for a long
   period. At the root of each trestle screen there is actually a a stack of
   VBTs, called the screen stack. The top VBT is connected to the screen. All
   the rest are unconnected to the screen and have empty domains. Initially,
   each stack contains the VBT that Trestle carves up into windows.

   of the previous top element of the screen stack, which is reformatted to be

TYPE
  Config &lt;: REFANY;
</PRE> A Trestle.Config represents an arrangement of the top-level windows of a
   window system. Essentially it is a list of name-position pairs for windows
   on the screen. The exact definition of a position depends on the window
   manager.

   screen id be c. Windows on screen id that are not in the configuration c
   will be iconized or moved in some window-manager-dependent way. Similarly,
   windows included in c that do not exist will (of necessity) be omitted from
   the configuration; a tiling window manager will adjust for this in a
   window-manager-dependent way. If the config includes two windows with the
   same name, or if two windows exist with the same name, the naming ambiguity
   will be resolved non-deterministically. If c is invalid, this operation is

      mouseThreshhold, mouseMultiplier: CARDINAL;
      autorepeat: BOOLEAN;
    END;
</PRE> Associated with every window system is a <CODE>Parameters</CODE> record 
   whose fields are defined as follows:
<P>
   The flag <CODE>peekABooCursor</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> if the window system hides the
   cursor when a character is typed and restores it when the mouse
   moves; otherwise the flag is <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.
<P>
   The value <CODE>slowTimeout</CODE> is the number of milliseconds the window
   system will wait for a client to respond to an event, assuming the
   client has responded promptly to its last event; <CODE>fastTimeout</CODE> is
   the number of milliseconds of the window system will wait for a
   client to respond to an event, assuming it has not responded promptly
   to its last event.
<P>
   If <CODE>flashNever</CODE> is set, then when a window does not respond to 
   an event promptly, Trestle stops waiting for it without any
   indication to the user that this has happened.  Otherwise,
   if  <CODE>flashOnce</CODE> is set, Trestle flickers the window when it
   exceeds its <CODE>slowTimeout</CODE>.  Otherwise, Trestle flickers the
   window whenever it exceeds either the <CODE>fastTimeOut</CODE> or the 
   <CODE>slowTimeout</CODE>.
<P>
   The value <CODE>doubleClickInterval</CODE> is the maximum number of <CODE>VBT.TimeStamp</CODE> 
   intervals allowed between two mouse transitions that can be 
   counted as part of a multiple click. 
<P>
   The value <CODE>safetyRadius</CODE> is the maximum motion allowed between two mouse
   transitions that can be counted as part of a mulitiple click.  The
   two positions must be within <CODE>safetyRadious</CODE> pixels of one another
   in both the <CODE>h</CODE> and <CODE>v</CODE> axes.
<P>
    The value <CODE>mouseThreshhold</CODE> and <CODE>mouseMultiplier</CODE> control the
    relation between mouse motion and cursor motion.  If the mouse moves
    more than <CODE>mouseThreshhold</CODE> pixels in a single sample interval,
    the excess is scaled by <CODE>mouseMultiplier</CODE>.  This applies separately
    in each coordinate.
<P>
    The value <CODE>autorepeat</CODE> is <CODE>TRUE</CODE> if the window system uses 
    auto-repeat mode for (some) keys that are held down long enough.
