</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Use 'Add' to notify the algorithm of all type specs making up the the set
which is to be processed. This set must be complete in the sense that if the
user adds type spec 't' to the set all component types of 't' must also be
added (e.g. if 't' is a ref type its referent type must be added as well).
  One way to 'Add' all type specs in a program is to use the tree walker. If
the tree walker is used there are some special cases to look out for:
1) Array types. 'Add' must be given arrays in normalised form. As the
normalised form of an array type is a semantic attribute the tree walker will
not walk it directly - the user will have to write a little extra code. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

  TypeSpecArray = ARRAY OF M3AST_AS.TYPE_SPEC;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="M3LTypeEquiv.m3.html#Partition">Partition</A>(): REF TypeSpecArray RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> When 'Add' has been used to build a full set of type specs 'Partition' can
be called to partition this set into sub sets of equivalent type specs. When
'Partition' completes all type specs in the set will have their type code
fields set. Type specs with the same type code represent equivalent types.
  The type codes will all be in the range 0..n-1 where n is the number of
different types in the given set. The result of 'Partition' is an array in
which each entry is a different type. The typecode of entry n in the array
will be n.
  Opaque types are special. Both the opaque type and its concrete type will
be given the same type code. If an opaque type has type code n then the entry
n in the result array will be the opaque type; to get to the concrete type it
is necessary to look at the opaque types 'sm_concrete_type_spec' field. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
