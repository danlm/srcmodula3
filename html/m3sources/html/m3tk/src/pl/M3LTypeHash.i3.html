<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="../ast/M3AST_AS.i3.html">M3AST_AS</A>;
</PRE> This module provides a quick way to distinguish types by using a type class
and a hash value. These have the property that if two types have the same class
and the same hash value they may be identical; if they do not they are
guaranteed to be non identical.
<P>
  The hash function used depends on names and default expressions within the
type, if present. In the case of constructor types it can also depend on the
hash values of the component types (e.g. when calculating the hash value for a
packed type the hash value of the unpacked type may be used). To prevent too
much recursion the hash values of component types are only used when the class
of the component type is less than the class of the constructor type.
  So, for example, the hash value of a packed array will not contain the hash
value of the array type because array types appear after packed types in the
'Class' ordering. This property is relied upon by the type equivalence
algorithm which uses the hash functions provided in this module.
  Note that 'Branded' covers branded objects, branded refs and opaque types -
because these are globally unique types they can be assigned a unique hash
value immediately. 
  The <CODE>Any</CODE> and <CODE>Type</CODE> cases cover the <CODE>Any_type</CODE> and <CODE>Type_type</CODE>
  types used in the standard interface (only).
