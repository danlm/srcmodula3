</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Compute the 'depends-on' relation for all the units in 'c', which
then defines the initialisation order of the modules in a program.
cl.callback is called for each unit in the context.  cl.context is set
to c before any callbacks. cl.callback should return TRUE if 'm' uses 'i'.  
'Default' returns a default closure whose callback returns TRUE if 'm' 
<CODE>uses</CODE> 'i', as defined in section 5.4 of the report.
However, since it is the <CODE>use</CODE> of another module from the initialisation
code of a module that is really significant, a clever client can do better. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
