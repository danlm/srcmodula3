</PRE> This is not intended as a client interface, but as support for the
implementation of various tree walk models. The <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> interface
provides one such model. All AST nodes, other than leaf nodes, must
provide an implementation of the <CODE>walk</CODE> method.  

<P><PRE>TYPE NODE = Previous_View.NODE OBJECT
  METHODS
    walk(handle: Handle) RAISES ANY := Null;
  END;

REVEAL AST.NODE &lt;: NODE;

TYPE
  <A HREF="ASTWalk.m3.html#Handle">Handle</A> &lt;: Handle_public;
  Handle_public = OBJECT
    METHODS
      Visit(n: AST.NODE) RAISES ANY;
  END;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="ASTWalk.m3.html#Null">Null</A>(n: NODE; handle: Handle) RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> returns immediately; used as default method </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END AST_WalkRep.
</PRE> The <CODE>walk</CODE> method visits the children of <CODE>self</CODE>, in some order
determined by the concrete method. The connection to the <CODE>callback</CODE>
interface provided by <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> is through <CODE>handle</CODE>, which provides
the <CODE>Visit</CODE> method. Each implementation of the <CODE>walk</CODE> method should
apply <CODE>Visit</CODE> to its children. The <CODE>Visit</CODE> method encapsulates the
callback and the application of <CODE>walk</CODE> to the child nodes. 
<P>
Since the connection to <CODE>ASTWalk</CODE> is decoupled by the <CODE>handle</CODE> type,
it is possible to devise alternate implementations of the <CODE>Visit</CODE>
method without altering this interface or the implementations of
the <CODE>walk</CODE> methods.
