INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="ASTCopy.m3.html">AST_CopyRep</A></interface>;
</PRE> This is not intended as a client interface, but as support for the
implementation of a tree copy interface. <CODE>ASTCopy</CODE> is one such
interface.  All AST nodes must provide an implementation of the <CODE>copy</CODE>
method.  

<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="AST.i3.html">AST</A>, <A HREF="AST_WalkRep.i3.html">AST_WalkRep</A>;

TYPE
  NODE = AST_WalkRep.NODE OBJECT
    METHODS
      copy(handle: Handle): AST.NODE RAISES ANY := Null;
    END;

REVEAL AST.NODE &lt;: NODE;

TYPE
  <A HREF="ASTCopy.m3.html#Handle">Handle</A> &lt;: Handle_public;
  Handle_public = OBJECT
    METHODS
      Copy(n: AST.NODE): AST.NODE RAISES ANY;
  END;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="ASTCopy.m3.html#Null">Null</A>(n: NODE; handle: Handle): AST.NODE RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> returns <CODE>NIL</CODE>; used as the default method </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

END AST_CopyRep.
</PRE> The <CODE>copy</CODE> method returns a copy of some part of the tree rooted at
the node making the call. At this level of abstraction <CODE>copy</CODE> is very
loosely defined. Precisely which attributes are copied, and whether
attributes are {\em shallow-copied} or {\em deep-copied} is left to
specific AST interfaces to define.
<P>
To aid in the creation of flexible copying interfaces, the <CODE>copy</CODE>
method takes a <CODE>Handle</CODE> argument, in a similar style to the <CODE>walk</CODE>
method defined in <CODE>AST_WalkRep</CODE>. Each implementation of the <CODE>copy</CODE>
method should create a new instance of itself and then apply
<CODE>handle.Copy</CODE> to each of its children in turn, children, assigning the
results to the corresponding child attributes of the new instance.
