</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Set 'sm_exp_type_spec' attribute of 'exp' and return it as the result.
  It is assumed that the components of 'exp' already have their
'sm_exp_type_spec' fields set. Thus this procedure is suitable for use by an
'ASTWalk.VisitMode.Exit' mode tree walk. Internally 'Set' may have to call
itself recursively to evaluate forward references; this does not concern the
tree walk as 'Set' can safely be called twice on the same expression.
  If the 'sm_exp_type_spec' attribute of 'exp' is already set, 'Set' does
nothing.
  'unit' gives the compilation unit in which 'exp' occurs.
  Assumes 'sm_def' attribute is set up. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

    : BOOLEAN
    RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Unfortunately the rules for variable recursion when a variable is typed by
its initializing expression are somewhat messy. This procedure is used if
'varId' has an initializing expression whose type is 'ts'. 'ts' must be non
NIL. 'RecursiveVariableType' returns TRUE and sets 'varId.tmp_recursive' to
TRUE if 'ts' recursively uses 'varId'. Otherwise FALSE is returned </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="M3CExpTypeSpec.m3.html#BaseType">BaseType</A>(
    ts: M3AST_SM.TYPE_SPEC_UNSET)
    : M3AST_SM.TYPE_SPEC_UNSET
    RAISES {};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> If 'ts' is unset, integer or an enumeration returns 'ts'
If 'ts' is a subrange type, returns the base type of the subrange.
If 'ts' is packed unpacks it and the returns to the beginning (i.e. checks if
it is unset, integer etc.)
Otherwise returns NIL.
  May call 'Set' to find the type of the bounding expressions of a subrange.
  This function is useful while the types of expressions are being set up.
Later passes of the compiler can use the 'sm_base_type_spec' attribute of a
subrange, which is set up AFTER expressions have been typed. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
