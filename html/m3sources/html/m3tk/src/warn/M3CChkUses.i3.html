</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Create a new handle with 'Node' as the callback procedure. 
If 'ignoreFORvars := FALSE', FOR loop control variables will not
be considered unused, even if they are! Since a 'Handle' is
a subtype of 'ASTWalk.Closure' it can be passed directly to
the tree walker. Alternatively, 'Node' can be called explicitly
from some other tree walk. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> This procedure is to be called from the tree walker (in entry and exit mode)
so that it is called on every node in an AST. It checks for unused declarations
and imports. It observes the UNUSED pragma. An interface containing a REVEAL 
statement is considered to be used irrespective of whether the revelation is
necessary. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
