</PRE> <CODE>M3FindFile</CODE> defines an abstract object type that provides some
basic file handling operations. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface>M3FindFile</interface>;

IMPORT <A HREF="../../../../rw/src/Common/Rd.i3.html">Rd</A>, <A HREF="../../../../os/src/Common/OSError.i3.html">OSError</A>, <A HREF="M3Extension.i3.html">M3Extension</A>;

EXCEPTION
  Failed;

TYPE
  T = OBJECT
  METHODS
    exts(): M3Extension.TSet;
    find(name: TEXT; ext: M3Extension.T): TEXT
        RAISES {Failed};
    openRead(name: TEXT; ext: M3Extension.T): Rd.T
        RAISES {OSError.E, Failed};
  END;

END M3FindFile.
</PRE> Objects of this type are used to find a file name given a module or
interface name and an extension.  The <CODE>exts</CODE> method returns the set of
extensions for which the file finder provides this lookup service.
Trying to look up a file with an extension not in the set returned by
<CODE>exts</CODE> will typically cause a checked runtime error.  The <CODE>find</CODE>
method does the work; it constructs the name of the file corresponding
to <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>ext</CODE> and returns it. If there is no such file it raises
<CODE>Failed</CODE>. For example a simple file <CODE>find</CODE> method might just use
<CODE>M3Extension.Extend</CODE> to construct a file name and then check if the
name corresponds to an existing file. More complex <CODE>find</CODE> methods
might look for the corresponding file in some list of locations.  Note
that on some systems a file may exist but it is impossible to tell
that it exists because it is totally inaccessible. If the file
corresponding to <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>ext</CODE> is totally inaccessible in this way
the <CODE>find</CODE> method will raise <CODE>Failed</CODE>. The <CODE>openRead</CODE> method tries to
open a reader on the pathname returned by <CODE>find(name, ext)</CODE>. If there
is no such file, <CODE>Failed</CODE> is raised. If an error occurs trying to open
the file, <CODE>OSError.E</CODE> is raised.
