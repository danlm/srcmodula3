 The above lines, and this line, and all lines up 
   to the first blank line, will be skipped by M3ToTex 

<P> The <CODE>Example</CODE> interface shows how to use <CODE>m3totex</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface>Example</interface>;

TYPE T &lt;: ROOT;
</PRE> An <CODE>Example.T</CODE> is an opaque object type. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE P(t: T; VAR (*OUT*) n: INTEGER);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Replace <CODE>t</CODE> by its hyperbolic completion and
   store its specular index in <CODE>n</CODE>. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> Comments that do not start in the first column are
   typeset like program text (for example, the comment
   <CODE>OUT</CODE> in the signature of <CODE>P</CODE>).
<P>
   Comments that start in the first column and are not
   preceded by a blank line are indented and slanted.
   They are intended to be used for short summary procedure
   specifications, like the one following the declaration
   of <CODE>P</CODE>.
<P>
   Comments that start in the first column and are
   preceded by a blank line are typeset in ordinary
   roman text, except that quoted words are typeset
   like program text (for example, <CODE>Example.T</CODE>). 
<P>
   If you want to include some verbatim material in a comment, precede
   each verbatim line by a vertical-bar and a space.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
      VAR t := NEW(t); n: INTEGER; BEGIN	
        WHILE n # 0 DO 
          P(t, n);
          <KBD>reduce the specular index of </KBD>t<KBD></KBD>.
        END
      END
</PRE>
Notice that you can escape into roman type by using 
back-quotes. 

<P><PRE>END Example.
