     checked. In particular, a left-recursive grammar will diverge, and
     a grammar attempting more-than-LL(1) backtracking will cause an
     error during parsing.
     The various grammar constructions are described below. *)

     in frames; the Stack index which is the &quot;base&quot; of the current frame is
     passed to client &quot;Action&quot; routines.

     definition of LL(1)). The result tree is the result tree of the successful
     branch (if any). Parsing fails if all the grammars in the list fail.

     Storage locations larger than the largest one used when &quot;iter&quot; was
