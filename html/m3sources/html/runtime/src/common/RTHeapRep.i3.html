<PRE><A HREF="../../../COPYRIGHT.html">Copyright (C) 1994, Digital Equipment Corp.</A>
</PRE> <CODE>RTHeapRep</CODE> is a private, implementation-dependent extension to
   <CODE>RTAllocator</CODE>, <CODE>RTCollector</CODE>, and <CODE>RTHeap</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>UNSAFE INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="#x1">RTHeapRep</A></interface>;
</PRE> This interface provides low-level access to the storage allocator and
   garbage collector.  Some items here should be made private or moved
   elsewhere. 

<P><PRE>IMPORT <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A>, <A HREF="RTHeapDep.i3.html">RTHeapDep</A>;
FROM <A HREF="RT0.i3.html">RT0</A> IMPORT Typecode;
</PRE> The allocator and collector maintain two heaps of objects.  One heap is
   <CODE>traced</CODE> (its objects are collected); the other is <CODE>untraced</CODE>.
<P>
   The allocator for the untraced heap is simply <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  Unless
   explicitly noted, all procedures and variables here are for the traced
   heap.  Unless explicitly noted, none of the variables in this interface
   are writable. 

<P>***** PAGES *****

<P> The (traced) heap consists of a number of aligned pages, divided among
   three spaces: Free, Previous, and Current.  All other pages in the
   address space are in the <CODE>Unallocated</CODE> space.  Pages are numbered 0, 1,
   2, ....  The pagesize used is fixed; if incremental or generational
   collection is to be allowed, it must be at least the VM page size.
<P>
   The global variable p0 and p1 hold the bounds of the heap pages: only
   pages in the range [p0, p1) are in a space other than Unallocated.  For
   these pages, the array <CODE>desc</CODE> holds more information; desc[p - p0] holds
   state for page <CODE>p</CODE>. 

<P><PRE>CONST
  BytesPerPage    = RTHeapDep.BytesPerPage;
  LogBytesPerPage = RTHeapDep.LogBytesPerPage;
  AdrPerPage      = RTHeapDep.AdrPerPage;
  LogAdrPerPage   = RTHeapDep.LogAdrPerPage;

TYPE Page = RTHeapDep.Page;

CONST
  Nil: Page = 0;                 (* page 0 cannot be part of the traced
                                    heap *)

VAR p0, p1: Page := Nil;

VAR desc: UNTRACED REF ARRAY OF Desc;

TYPE
  Desc = RECORD
           space     : BITS 2 FOR Space;
           generation: BITS 1 FOR Generation;
           pure      : BITS 1 FOR BOOLEAN;

           link: BITS BITSIZE(ADDRESS) - LogAdrPerPage FOR Page := Nil;
         END;

TYPE Space = {Unallocated, Free, Previous, Current};
</PRE> Each page has a short note attached, describing why it is in its current
   state.  This is usually used for performance monitoring. 

<P><PRE>TYPE
  Note = {OlderGeneration,       (* page promoted to current space because
                                    it it contained the older generation

                                    state *)
          Large,                 (* page promoted to current space because
                                    it contains a single accessible object,
                                    so no garbage would be collected by
                                    copying the object *)
          Frozen,                (* page contains frozen ref *)
          Allocated,             (* page was allocated in current space *)

                                    from previous space *)
</PRE> The collector can be generational; the heap is divided into two
   generations. 

<P><PRE>TYPE Generation = {Older, Younger};

VAR
  allocatedPages: CARDINAL := 0; (* the number of pages in the Free,
                                    Previous, or Current spaces *)
</PRE>***** HEAP OBJECTS *****

<P> An object is a contiguous array of words on the heap.  The first word of
   an object is its header.  The object's body begins at the second word,
   its address is the object's REF.  All object bodies are aligned.
<P>
   <CODE>Small</CODE> objects never cross a page boundary.  <CODE>Large</CODE> objects are larger
   than a page; they span multiple contiguous pages.  For large objects,
   pages following the first are marked <CODE>continued</CODE>.  The large object is
   the only object on its pages; it starts at the beginning of its first
   page, and no other objects follow it on its last page.
<P>
   Special <CODE>filler</CODE> objects are used to exactly fill out the end of a page
   of small objects, or to fill space between small objects when they
   cannot exactly follow the previous object because of alignment
   restrictions.  There are 1-word and multi-word filler objects.  The
   beginning of a page is always adequate alignment, so a filler object
   need never begin a page. 

<P><PRE>TYPE
  Header = RT0.RefHeader;
  RefHeader = UNTRACED REF Header;

CONST
  Fill_1_type: Typecode = LAST(Typecode); (* 1 word filler *)
  FillHeader1: Header = Header{typecode := Fill_1_type, forwarded := FALSE};

CONST
  Fill_N_type: Typecode = LAST(Typecode) - 1;
  FillHeaderN: Header = Header{typecode := Fill_N_type, forwarded := FALSE};
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> multi-word filler, the second word is the total size of the object,
   in bytes </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE>***** OPEN ARRAYS *****

<P> An open array object with N open dimensions contains a header, then a
   pointer to the first data element, then N integers that hold the
   dimensions. 

<P><PRE>TYPE ArrayShape = UNTRACED REF ARRAY [0 .. (*N-1*) 999] OF INTEGER;

PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTHeapRep.m3.html#UnsafeGetShape">UnsafeGetShape</A> (    r          : REFANY;
                          VAR nDimensions: INTEGER;
                          VAR s          : ArrayShape);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> if r is a reference to an open array, the number of open dimensions,
   nDimensions, and size of each dimension, s, is returned.  The array's
   shape vector is valid as long as r exists.  If r is not a reference to
   an open array, nDimensions = 0 and s is undefined.  It is an unchecked
   runtime error to modify s^, to free s, or to use it after r has been
   garbage collected. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE>***** LOW-LEVEL ALLOCATOR/COLLECTOR ****

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#AllocForNew">AllocForNew</A> (size, alignment: CARDINAL): ADDRESS;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Return the address of <CODE>size</CODE> bytes of traced storage on an
   <CODE>alignment</CODE> byte boundary.  The storage is not zeroed. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#Malloc">Malloc</A> (size: INTEGER): ADDRESS;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Return the address of <CODE>size</CODE> bytes of untraced, zeroed storage </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE>***** MODULE OBJECTS *****

<P> A Modula-3 object is appears to the collector like any other object.
   The first word of its body is a pointer to its method list. 

<P><PRE>CONST MethodListOffset = 0;      (* byte offset in the object's body *)
</PRE> RegisterFinalCleanup is available for low-level cleanup by the thread
   package.  If <CODE>r</CODE> is registered for cleanup, then just before <CODE>r</CODE> is
   freed, the cleanup procedure <CODE>p</CODE> is called.  This procedure is allowed
   to dereference <CODE>r</CODE> to copy out data, not including traced references.
<P>
   Although the thread package could use ordinary weak refs, this operation
   is easy to provide and is a little more efficient.  The thread package
   cannot use weak refs straight on public types because its clients should
   remain free to use weak refs on subtypes. 

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#RegisterFinalCleanup">RegisterFinalCleanup</A> (r: REFANY; p: PROCEDURE (r: REFANY));
</PRE>***** COLLECTOR STATUS AND CONTROL *****

<P> There are various status variables. 

<P><PRE>VAR collections := 0;            (* the number of collections begun *)

VAR
  disableCount: CARDINAL := 0;   (* how many more Disables than Enables *)

  disableVMCount: CARDINAL := 0; (* how many more DisableVMs than
                                    EnableVMs *)

PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#Crash">Crash</A> (): BOOLEAN;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Crash is called by the runtime when the program is about to crash.  When
   Crash returns, the entire heap is readable, and no further heap objects
   will move or be protected.  Crash attempts to finish the current
   collection.  If Crash returns TRUE, the current collection, if any,
   successfully completed. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> We maintain counts of pages in the current pace allocated by <CODE>NEW</CODE>, by
   copying, and by promotion, for pages for small objects and for large
   objects. 

<P><PRE>VAR
  smallNewPages, largeNewPages            : CARDINAL := 0;
  smallCopyPages, largeCopyPages          : CARDINAL := 0;

</PRE>** VM support **

<P><PRE>PROCEDURE <A HREF="RTCollector.m3.html#Fault">Fault</A> (addr: ADDRESS): BOOLEAN;
</PRE> Fault is called from the RTHeapDep when a VM fault occurs.  If Fault
   returns TRUE, protection has been changed and the operation should be
   retried.  If Fault returns FALSE, the faulting address is not part of
   the traced heap, and the fault should be treated as an error. 

<P>***** DEBUGGING *****

<P> There are various routines for collecting or printing out information on
   the objects on the heap. 

<P><PRE>TYPE
  RefVisitor = OBJECT
               METHODS
                 visit (tc: Typecode; r: REFANY; size: CARDINAL): BOOLEAN;

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Visit all the traced references in the heap, and call proc.visit for
   each one of them.  Garbage collection is disabled during that visit and
   you should refrain from allocating memory in proc. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
