</PRE> Zeus is a kernel for both multi-view editors and algorithm animation
   systems.  To a first approximation, it follows the spirit of BALSA, but
   implemented in a multi-threaded environment using an object-oriented,
   strongly-typed language.
<P>
   For historical reasons, it is the ZeusPanel and ZeusClass interfaces,
   not this interface, that are of primary interest to clients.  This
   interface explains what's going on behind the scenes; it is used by
   ZeusPanel (to provide a system for algorithm animation ) and systems
   doing multi-view editing (like the Modula-2+ version of formsedit).  If
   you are animating an algorithm and find yourself needing to import this
   interface, then something is probably wrong.  Let us know.

&lt;* PRAGMA LL *&gt;
</PRE> Overview...
<P>
   Zeus provides a domain-independent framework and methodology for
   associating multiple client-defined <CODE>views</CODE> with sets of client-defined
   <CODE>events.</CODE> A view is implemented as a ZeusClass.T with additional suites
   of procedures to handle client-defined events.  The appropriate
   event-handling procedure is invoked by Zeus in response to an event
   generated by one of the other views.
<P>
   One of the views is designated as the <CODE>algorithm.</CODE> This view is special
   because it acts as the <CODE>server</CODE> for event distribution: events that
   originate in the algorithm are distributed to all views, and events that
   originate in a view are distributed to the algorithm.  The algorithm is
   also special because it can never be detached from its instance, once
   the instance is created.
<P>
   Clients who use Zeus for algorithm animation should probably use the
   ZeusPanel interface.  That interface provides a <CODE>control panel</CODE> in a
   Trestle window.  The control panel allows the user to choose algorithms
   and views, and to control the execution of algorithms.  It also provides
   a very simple client-programmer interface.
<P>
   Clients who use Zeus for controling a multi-view editor should use this
   interface directly.  The ControlPanel implementation is a good example
   of how this interface is used in practice.
<P>
   By now, you are probably wondering how algorithm animation differs from
   multi-view editing.  The basic difference is that in multi-view editing
   all events are generated in response to user actions in views.  In
   algorithm animation, a subroutine associated with the algorithm is
   invoked to generate events.  When using the ZeusPanel interface, the user
   can single-step or suspend the execution in terms of events generated by
   algorithms.

</PRE> About events...
<P>
   There are events that go from an algorithm to all views, and events from
   a view to the algorithm.  There's also a special event, called a
   Broadcast event, that goes first to the algorithm, and then to all
   views.
<P>
   There are three types of events that go from an algorithm to views:
   Output, Update, and Code.  The Output events and Code events are for
   algorithm animations that utilize the ZeusPanel.  The ZeusPanel will
   gain control before and after each event, in order to implement
   Stepping, Stopping, and Resuming.  Code events are used, along with the
   ZeusCodeView interface, for textual display of the program that the
   algorithm is executing.  Update events bypass the ZeusPanel.  They are
   used for responding to events from a view, usually to dispatch
   information to all other views.
<P>
   There are two types of events that go from a view to its algorithm: Edit
   and Notify.  Notify events are used in algorithm animation; Edit events
   are not.  Whenever a view interprets some user gestures into an action,
   it generates either an Edit or Notify event to the algorithm.  The
   algorithm makes the appropriate changes to its data structures, and then
   generates an Update event to the views.  The views update themselves
   based on these events.  (In response to an Edit, Notify, or Update
   event, the event handler can inquire which view initiated the editing
   action.)
<P>
   Each Zeus instance has an editing lock.  The lock prevents other views
   from issuing Edit events while another view is in the midst of a command
   that requires multiple Edit events.  When an Edit event is attempted
   while the editing lock is held by some other view, an exception is
   raised.  The Notify event should be used to bypass the editing lock (for
   example, for a view to set a selection).
<P>
   Here's a summary of the six types of events in Zeus:
<P>
   * Output: alg -&gt; views, with ZeusPanel intervention
<P>
   * Code: alg -&gt; views (ZeusCodeView only), with ZeusPanel intervention
<P>
   * Update: alg -&gt; views, bypassing ZeusPanel (responding to Edit/Notify)
<P>
   * Edit: view -&gt; alg, checking the edit lock
<P>
   * Notify: view -&gt; alg, bypassing the edit lock
<P>
   * Broadcast: view -&gt; alg, bypassing the edit lock alg -&gt; views,
   bypassing ZeusPanel
<P>
   In some special circumstances, it is reasonable for views to directly
   communicate with each other (e.g., only one of the views supports Undo).
   It's also reasonable for algorithms to directly communicate with a
   particular view (e.g., to bring it up to date when it is first
   installed). 

<P>
<P> About concurrency and locking...
<P>
   Most of the procedures in this interface are called when VBT.mu is held.
   That is, they are intended to be called in reponse to some user mouse or
   keyboard activity.  Although not documented as such, they may not be
   called concurrently.
<P>
   A notable exception is that Output events are not necessarily generated
   with LL=VBT.mu, and it isn't reasonable to lock the window system on
   each event.  Consequently, this interface does its own locking to ensure
   that ChangeAlg, AttachView, DetachView, and Destroy cannot be entered
   while there is an event (an event of any flavor) in progress;
   conversely, calls to ChangeAlg, AttachView, DetachView, or Destroy are
   serialized, and will block any call to Dispatch.
<P>
   While on the subject of locking, it's important to keep in mind that
   repaint and reformat requests arrive from the window system
   asynchronously with respect to the executing algorithm.  (They do happen
   with VBT.mu locked by some ancestor, however.) It's the responsibility
   of each view to synchronize its repaint and reformat requests with
   Output events that it processes.  If a view uses an algorithm's data
   structures (as opposed to local copies), it must synchronize its access
   to these structures in its repaint and reformat procedures.
<P>
   Multi-threaded algorithms require a bit more work.  By design, Zeus does
   not serialize any of the Output events.  Therefore, multiple Output
   events may happen simultaneously, while other threads in the algorithm
   are still executing.  The view must be careful to coordinate access to
   both the data structures it shares with the algorithm and the data
   structures that various event handlers share. 

<P>
<P><PRE>EXCEPTION Error(REFANY);
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> This exception should be raised by an event handling procedure to report
   back to the initiator of the event.  Although Update and Output events
   invoke the event handlers of multiple views, it reports back to the

   all views that raised the exception. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
