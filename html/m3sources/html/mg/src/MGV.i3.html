      (* The mouse/selector/selectee methods combine to define the
         selection actions on a V.  The mouse method normally just
         translates the mouse point from screen coordinates to MG

         selector.select does low-level, element oriented selection.  It is
         called with v.mu locked and finds the element(s) that are
         selected.  The default selector returns the closest element, but
         other selectors could return the closest group, a group of the
         elements within some distance, the group containing the closest
         ellipse, etc.

         selectee.select handles the higher-level actions of the selection.
         It is called with whatever elements the selector returns.  It is
         normally view specific and handles the highlight actions
         associated with the selection and the input events to the
         algorithm.  The default selectee does nothing. *)

      Here are 2 potential Shape methods.  ShapeStretchy is the default

for an MGV.T
<P>
   ShapeFixed returns a size range of {pref, pref, pref + 1}

   ShapeStretchy returns a size range of 
     {0, pref, MAX(pref + 1, VBT.DefaultShape.hi)}

</PRE> Here are 2 potential Reshape methods.  ReshapeSWOrigin is the 
   default for an MGV.T.
<P>
   ReshapeSWOrigin moves the MG graphical origin to the south west

<P>
   ReshapeLeaveOrigin leaves the MG graphical origin alone when
   <CODE>v</CODE> is reshaped.  It leaves the v.nw value unchanged so
   that views that display themselves relative to the NW corner
   of the window or which set v.nw should use this reshape 
   method.
