                              mode: int;
                              ndigits: int;
                              decpt: int_star;
		              sign: int_star;
                              rve: char_star_star): char_star;

  (* Arguments ndigits, decpt, sign are similar to those
     of ecvt and fcvt; trailing zeros are suppressed from
     the returned string.  If not null, *rve is set to point
     to the end of the return value.  If d is +-Infinity or NaN,
     then *decpt is set to 9999.

        mode:
                0 ==&gt; shortest string that yields d when read in
                        and rounded to nearest.
                1 ==&gt; like 0, but with Steele &amp; White stopping rule;
                        e.g. with IEEE P754 arithmetic , mode 0 gives
                        1e23 whereas mode 1 gives 9.999999999999999e22.
                2 ==&gt; ndigits significant digits.  This gives a return
                        value similar to that of ecvt, except that
                        trailing zeros are suppressed.
                3 ==&gt; through ndigits past the decimal point.  This
                        gives a return value similar to that from fcvt,
                        except that trailing zeros are suppressed.
                4-9 should give the same return values as 2-3, i.e.,
                        4 &lt;= mode &lt;= 9 ==&gt; same return as mode
                        2 + (mode &amp; 1).  These modes are mainly for
                        debugging; often they run slower but sometimes
                        faster than modes 2-3.
                4,5,8,9 ==&gt; left-to-right digit generation.
                6-9 ==&gt; don't try fast floating-point estimate
                        (if applicable).

                Values of mode other than 0-9 are treated as mode 0.

                Sufficient space is allocated to the return value
                to hold the suppressed trailing zeros.
