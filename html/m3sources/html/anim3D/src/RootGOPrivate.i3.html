</PRE> <CODE>root.repair(damaged)</CODE> redraws the scene rooted at <CODE>root</CODE>. Only those
   nodes that were marked as damaged are re-rendered, for the other nodes,
   cached values are used. 
<P>
   Nodes can be damaged in two ways: 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item By operations that change the scene DAG (i.e.\ the group operations
         <CODE>add</CODE>, <CODE>remove</CODE>, and <CODE>flush</CODE>).
   \item By changes in the value of an attached property. 
   \end{enumerate}
<P>
   Calling <CODE>root.adjust(time)</CODE> serves two purposes: It reevaluates all the 
   properties attached to all descendants of <CODE>root</CODE>, and damages those nodes 
   whose properties have changed since the last round of rendering. It also
   propagates damages up the scene DAGs.
       <CODE>
   </CODE>root.repair(damaged)<CODE> is called after all roots have been adjusted. The 
   VAR parameter </CODE>damaged<CODE> is set to TRUE if there were any damages in the 
   scene, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
