&lt;* PRAGMA LL *&gt;
&lt;* PRAGMA SUBTYPE *&gt;
</PRE> An <CODE>ZChildVBT.T</CODE> is a VBT that is typically used as a subwindow.
<P>
   A <CODE>ZChildVBT</CODE> is a subclass of a <CODE>HighlightVBT</CODE> that insulates any
   highlighting done in the <CODE>ZChildVBT</CODE> from highlighting done in
   other subwindows.  Clients should use a <CODE>ZBackgroundVBT</CODE> around the
   background child in order to insulate highlighting in the
   background child from highlighting in the subwindows.
<P>
   There are two alternate ways to initialize a <CODE>ZChildVBT</CODE>. Each
   allows the client to specify whether the subwindow should be
   initially visible (``mapped'') and how the subwindow should
   be reshaped when the parent <CODE>ZSplit</CODE> is reshaped.
<P>
   The method call <CODE>v.init(...)</CODE> allows the client to specify where
   the center or a corner of <CODE>v</CODE> should be placed, relative to the
   parent, either in absolute distance (in millimeters) from the
   parent's northwest corner (<CODE>CoordType.Absolute</CODE>), or as percentages
   of the parent's width and height (<CODE>CoordType.Scaled</CODE>).  The default
   is to align the center of <CODE>v</CODE> with the center of the parent. The size
   of <CODE>v</CODE> is its preferred sizes in both the horizontal and vertical
   dimensions.
<P>
   The method call <CODE>v.initFromEdges(...)</CODE> allows the client to specify
   the edges of <CODE>v</CODE>, either in absolute distance (in millimeters) from
   the parent's northwest corner (this is the only case in which the
   client specifies the absolute size of <CODE>v</CODE>), or as percentages of
   the parent's width and height.
<P>
   The implementation will not pop up a subwindow with its northwest
   corner north or west of the visible portion of the <CODE>ZSplit</CODE> parent;
   it will override the specified position as necessary to bring it
   into view. It is a checked runtime error to specify scaled
   coordinates (percentages) that are outside the range 0.0--1.0.
   If the specified position is overriden, or if the subwindow is 
   not entirely visible when the subwindow is first made visible, 
   the implementation will also override the reshape method so that 
   the subwindow will be repositioned using the information specified
   when it was initialized.
<P>
   Finally, in order for the reformatting to meet specifications
   above, the client must call <CODE>Inserted</CODE> after the subwindow is
   inserted as a child of a <CODE>ZSplit</CODE>; the client must call <CODE>Moved</CODE>
   after the subwindow is repositioned by the user; and the client
   must call <CODE>Grew</CODE> after the size of the subwindow is changed by the
   user.

</PRE> Finally, here are a few <CODE>ZSplit</CODE> reshape controllers
   that are sometimes useful:  

<P><PRE>VAR (*CONST*)
  Scaled: ZSplit.ReshapeControl;
  ScaledHFixed: ZSplit.ReshapeControl;
  ScaledVFixed: ZSplit.ReshapeControl;
  ScaledHVFixed: ZSplit.ReshapeControl;
</PRE> <CODE>Scaled</CODE> reshapes the child by 
   scaling the old child domain to occupy the same relative position
   of the changing parent domain. <CODE>ScaledHFixed</CODE> does the same, and then
   insets the west and east edges so that the child's width is not
   changed. Similarly, <CODE>ScaledVFixed</CODE> scales the child's domain and then
   insets the north and south edges. <CODE>ScaledHVFixed</CODE> insets both the
   north and south edges and the west and east edges so the size of
   the child's domain stays fixed. In other words, <CODE>ScaledHVFixed</CODE> can
   be used to reposition the center point of the child without changing
   its size.
