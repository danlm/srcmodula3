<h1>Updating a text window</h1>

A text VBT does not have to display an unchanging string
like the label in a button.
Using the subprocedure <code>TextVBT.Put</code> it is possible to
update the window so that it displays different text.
Program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/update/Update.m3.html">Update.m3</a>
illustrates this.
Everytime the <code>Inc</code> button is pushed
a global variable is incremented.
The new value is displayed in the main window.
Converting an integer to a string requires
the procedure <code>Int</code>
from the standard library module <code>Fmt</code>.

In the horizontal bar across the top of the window are two
buttons.
Besides the <code>Inc</code> button there is the <code>Exit</code> button
which terminates the program.
The two VBT's are joined horizontally into a split VBT.
Unlike a text VBT
a split VBT has other VBT's as subordinate pieces.
The function <code>Cons</code> in the <code>HVSplit</code> interface joins
several VBT's into a horizontal or vertical unit.

A <code>TextureVBT</code>, a leaf VBT, is used to make a long, thin VBT
of a particular texture and color,
In this case, a solid VBT of the background color is used to
divide the button bar from the main window showing the text.
All three VBTs are aligned vertically and a border is drawn
around them.

The following images
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../update/update1.gif">Update 1
  <li> <img src="../update/update2.gif">Update 2
</ul>
contain two views of the screen during the running of the program.
In the first we see what is displayed when the
program is first executed.
The initial value of the variable <code>num</code> is 97.
In the second we see the situation
after the <code>Inc</code> button has been pressed several times.
The current value of the variable <code>num</code>, 102, is displayed
in the window.
