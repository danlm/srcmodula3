<h1>Three-dimensional shadows</h1>

It is possible to give shadows to VBT's to give them a three-dimensional appearance.
This requires the modules <code>Shadow</code> and <code>ShadowVBT</code> from VBTKit.
VBTKit is an additional collection of modules and a library built on top of Trestle.
<p>

The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/shadow/Main.m3.html">Main.m3</a>
illustrates the different kinds of shadows in VBTKit.
Each kind of shadow gives a different three-dimensional appearance to the associated VBT.
There are five different styles of shadows:
flat, raised, lowered, ridged and chiseled.
A shadow object (a value of type <code>Shadow.T</code>),
however, is just a size and some colors.
<pre>
Shadow.New (
    size := 7.0,       (* width of shadow around VBT in points   *)
    bg := grey,        (* color of background for flat style     *)
    light := lgrey,    (* one color of the shadow                *)
    dark := dgrey      (* another color of the shadow            *)
);
</pre>
These values are used to control the size and the color of the shadow.
<p>


The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/shadow/Main.m3.html">Main.m3</a>
creates a button in each of the five styles.
The shadowed VBT takes a <code>Shadow.T</code> as an argument.
The images
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../shadow/shadow1.gif">Shadow 1
  <li> <img src="../shadow/shadow2.gif">Shadow 2
</ul>
show two views of the application.
When a button is depressed the text changes, but not the shadow.
To change the appearance of the shadow in response to actions by the user
a new kind of VBT is required called a feedback.
These are illustrated in the next section
<a href="../feedback/tut-feedback.html">Feedback for buttons</a>.
