<h1>Catching mouse events</h1>

The program
<a href="../mouse/Mouse.m3-elided">Mouse.m3</a>
illustrates different kinds of mouse events.
The application displays a blank area on the left
where you can click with the mouse.
The event is analyzed and displayed
in the five fields on the right. They are:
<dl>
  <dt>what changed </dt>
  <dd>
       which button was involved in the event (left, right or middle).
  </dd>
  <dt>time</dt>
  <dd>
       the Trestle time stamp at which the event was generated.
  </dd>
  <dt>cp</dt>
  <dd>
       the current cursor position in the VBT's coordinate system.
  </dd>
  <dt>modifiers</dt>
  <dd>
       which keys from among the option, shift, lock, and control keys
       that were pressed down when the event was generated.
  </dd>
  <dt>click type</dt>
  <dd>
       what kind of mouse click: <code>FirstDown</code>, <code>OtherDown</code>,
       <code>FirstUp</code> or LastUp.
  </dd>
  <dt>click count</dt>
  <dd>
       the number of times the mouse button was clicked rapidly in row just before this event was generated.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>

The blank area in the window
that catches the mouse events
is created by a subtype of <code>LeafVBT</code>.
A <code>LeafVBT</code> is so primitive that it does not even redraw itself.
So we override the <code>repaint</code> method with one that does the repainting.
In this case there is nothing important to do,
just fill in with the background color.
The mouse events are caught by supplying our own <code>mouse</code> method
which does much more than the default <code>mouse</code> method
(which does nothing).
<p>

Our <code>mouse</code> method, called <code>MouseEvent</code> is in
<a href="../mouse/Event.m3-sep">Event.m3</a>.
It receives a data structure called <code>MouseRec</code>.
The method extracts the various pieces of the structure and
displays them in the appropriate text fields of the main application.
<p>

Two views of the application while it is running are show in:
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../mouse/mouse1.gif">Mouse 1
  <li> <img src="../mouse/mouse2.gif">Mouse 2
</ul>
