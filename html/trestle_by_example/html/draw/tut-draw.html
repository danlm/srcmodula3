<h1>Drawing lines on a window</h1>

The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/draw/Draw.m3.html">Draw.m3</a>
demonstrates how lines and curves are drawn in a VBT.
The basic primitive line segments are part of the <code>Path</code>
interface.
Each segment can be straight or curved.
The <code>Stroke</code> method of the <code>VBT</code> interface actually draws
the shape given by a path.
<p>

The result is shown in the image Draw:

<br>
An object of type <code>TexasVBT</code>
contains a path that is roughly in the shape of the state of Texas.
This shape is carefully designed not in accordance with the precise geography
of the state, but so that a tessellation of the plane is possible.
The path is made in units of pixels.
The <code>Repaint</code> subprocedure uses the path to draw the shape
is several places.
Four vertically ascending rows are drawn.
A nested subprocedure <code>Pair</code> draws two adjacent shapes at a time.
One is filled in with the color red,
the other is outlined in the color blue.
<p>

Rather than create the paint operations explicitly in the main
program module,
this program (and all the remaining programs that require them)
import the operations from another module.
This module,
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/common/Colors.i3.html">Colors.i3</a>,
serves no other purpose than
removing some code from the program.
The painting operations that the module provides are
those that simply paint a particular solid color.
A number
of different paint operations are provided
including the <code>red</code>, <code>white</code>, and <code>blue</code>
operations used by
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/draw/Draw.m3.html">Draw.m3</a>.
The implementation of the module,
as well as the interface,
can be found in the appendix
<a href="../common/tut-common.html">Auxiliary Modules</a>.
