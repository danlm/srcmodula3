<h1>Numeric scrollers</h1>

VBTkit contains a VBT that can be used to change a numeric value.
It is similar to <code>NumericVBT</code> in that
the value can be restricted to some minimum and maximum.
But instead of a type-in field,
the value is changed by dragging an indicator (called a
<em>stripe</em>)
toward one extreme or the other.
Clicking the left or right mouse button moves the stripe one step.
Holding the mouse button down causes continuous scrolling.
Clicking the middle mouse button causes the top of the stripe to move to the
position of the cursor (this is called <em>thumbing</em>).
Holding the middle button down causes continuous thumbing.
<p>

A <code>ScrollerVBT</code> can be created as follows:
<pre>
NEW(ScrollerVBT.T).init(axis, min, max, colors, step, thumb)
</pre>
where <code>axis</code> makes the scroller either horizontal or vertical,
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
re the extreme integer values of the scroller,
<code>colors</code> is a <code>PaintOp.ColorQuad</code>,
<code>step</code> is the amount to change while continuously scrolling,
and <code>thumb</code> governs the size of the stripe
(the default size of 0 is usually the right choice).

The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/scroll/Scroll.m3.html">Scroll.m3</a>
uses three numeric scrollers to
keep track of degrees, minutes, and seconds in the range
from -180 to 180 degrees.
Actually,
since the three scrollers are independent, the maximum
value is 180 degrees 59 minutes and 59 seconds.
Likewise the minimum value is less than $-180$.
