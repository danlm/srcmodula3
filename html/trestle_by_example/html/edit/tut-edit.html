<h1>Editing single and multiple lines of text</h1>

The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/edit/Edit.m3.html">Edit.m3</a>
illustrates how to use the multiple line and single line text editors.
The VBTkit module <code>TextPort</code> does all the work.
The program
creates two <code>TextPort</code> VBTs.
One is the size of just one line of text;
the other holds as many lines as it can.
Both <code>TextPort</code>s are edited using emacs-like commands.
This capability is provided by the <code>TextPort</code> along
with several other editing options.
The application prints the text of the <code>TextPort</code>s if
either has been modified.
The function <code>TextPort.IsModified</code> provides the test,
and
the function <code>TextPort.Get</code> retrieves the text.
<p>

The following images
<ul>
<li> <img src="../edit/edit1.gif">Edit 1
<li> <img src="../edit/edit2.gif">Edit 2
</ul>
show two views of the application after some editing has modified the
original contents of the <code>TextPort</code>s.
A long thin, vertical bar marks the position in the text
where keyboard input will affect the text.
A slightly thicker line shows the end of the multi-line text
or where a line has been wrapped around the window.
<p>


The module <code>TextPort</code> provides a VBT with quite sophisticated
functionality.
This module is part of VBTKit---an additional collection of
modules for Trestle.
All the previous programs can be compiled without the VBTKit
interface files and do not require the VBTKit library.
This program and most of the rest of the programs require VBTKit.
