<h1>Catching keyboard events</h1>

The program
<a href="../../../m3sources/html/trestle_by_example/src/key/Key.m3.html">Key.m3</a>
demonstrates catching keyboard events.
The program defines a new VBT that acquires keyboard
events whenever the mouse moves into the VBT.
If a key is pressed and released while the mouse
is in the window and if it is a printable character,
then the character is displayed in the window.
<p>

We have named the new VBT <code>KeyVBT</code>.
It is a subtype
of <code>TextVBT.T</code> which itself is a subtype of <code>VBT.T</code>.
The type <code>KeyVBT</code>
overrides the <code>position</code> and <code>key</code> methods
of <code>VBT.T</code>.
For convenience we have written an <code>init</code> procedure
which hides the <code>init</code> procedure of <code>TextVBT.T</code>.
However the <code>init</code> procedure of the superclass does all the work
in the line
<pre>
EVAL TextVBT.T.init (v, t, fnt:=f);
</pre>
of the program.
<p>

Handling the keyboard events requires two main parts.
These are accomplished in the procedures <code>Position</code> and <code>Key</code>
of program <code>Key</code>.
The procedure <code>Position</code> acquires the keyboard focus
for the application,
if the mouse pointer moves into the application's <code>KeyVBT</code>.
Then if a key is pressed in the VBT
and this key is a printable character,
the subprocedure <code>Key</code> sets the text to the appropriate character.
<p>

The situation is depicted in a series of snapshots of the
application
<ul>
  <li> <img src="../key/key1.gif">Key 1
  <li> <img src="../key/key2.gif">Key 2
  <li> <img src="../key/key3.gif">Key 3
</ul>
The initial text is the string <code>[uninitialized]</code>.
After the key ``F'' is pressed in the <code>KeyVBT</code>,
the text is changed to <code>character 'F'</code>.
After the key ``%'' is pressed,
the text is changed to the <code>character '%'</code>.
