<h2>The Third Modula-3 User Group Meeting</h2>
<h3>OOPSLA'94, Portland, Oregon. Report by Farshad Nayeri.</h3>
<hr>

<p>
The third Modula-3 User Group meeting was a success thanks to the
participants and presenters! In the short time of two hours,
six presenters talked about their experiences with Modula-3 and
what they are doing with it. The
attendance was solid (20-30 people), given our limited public
announcement and the timing of the event. 

<p>
Although there was no discussion section during the meeting itself,
some of the participants joined us at a round-table discussion of
Modula-3 and its needs before it can become a popular programming
platform.

<h2>Presentations</h2>

<dt><b>Geoff Wyant</b>,
Sun Microsystems Laboratories, geoff.wyant@sun.com
<p>
<dd><b>Modula-3 at Sun Microsystems Laboratories</b>

<p> The Vantage Project at Sun Microsystems Laboratories is
investigating structuring and reliability mechanisms for very large
distributed object systems. Modula-3 is the principal implementation
language for the project.  The project has built several protocols on
top of Modula-3 Network Objects, and is building some tools for
programming with Network Objects, among which are IDLNO, an OMG
translator for Modula-3 Network Objects, and CM3, a tool for easy
integration of C clients of Modula-3 libraries.(See <a
HREF="slides-Sun.ps">Geoff's slides</a>.)<p>

<dt><b>Luca Cardelli</b>, Digital Systems Research Center, luca@src.dec.com
<p>
<dd><b>Obliq
and Visual Obliq</b> <p> Obliq is a lexically-scoped untyped interpreted
language that supports distributed object-oriented computation.  An
Obliq computation may involve multiple threads of control within an
address space, multiple address spaces on a machine, heterogeneous
machines over a local network, and multiple networks over the
Internet.  Obliq objects have state and are local to a site. Obliq
computations can roam over the network, while maintaining network
connections.

Quick Start</A>, or <A
HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Luca_Cardelli/Slides/ObliqSlides.ps.Z">Luca's
slides</A> [suitable for Mac-compatible laser printers])

<p> 

Luca also gave some hints about M3/Lite, the small foot-print version
of Modula-3 to run on PCs running Chicago. As we all know by now, Bill
Kalsow is in the process of releasing version 3.4 as a step towards
M3/Lite. Luca also said a couple of words about Juno-2, Greg Nelson's
constraint-based drawing package will be released sometime soon.

<dt><b>Eliot Moss</b>,
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, moss@cs.umass.edu
<p>
<dd><b>History and status of UMass work on Modula-3 compilers</b>


<p> Object Systems Laboratory of UMass at Amherst have been working on
various aspects of Modula-3 implementations, including support for
advanced garbage collection and persistence mechanisms for several
years. Eliot gave an informal presentation about what some of his
students are working on for providing optimization and persistence
support for Modula-3.

<dt><b>Steve Freeman</b>, Xerox Grenoble, France, steve.freeman@xerox.fr
<p><dd><b>Adding video
capabilities to Trestle/Modula-3</b>

<p>VideoVBT is the integration of digital video into Trestle, an
object-oriented user interface toolkit written in Modula-3. The
display of video frames is managed within the application process
using, where possible, shared memory to transmit images to the window
system. VideoVBT takes advantage of Modula-3's type system,
lightweight threads and garbage collection to develop a flexible
architecture that supports the reuse of image data within an
application; the object-oriented features of Modula-3 we found most
useful were inheritance, partial revelations, and encapsulation.
VideoVBT is also integrated into several higher-level tools, such as
FormsVBT (a user interface management system) and Obliq (a distributed
scripting language; see above) which allow us to dynamically
experiment with video applications.

<dt><b>Mike Spreitzer</b>,

<p><dd><b>Inter-Language Unification</b> 

<p> ILU (pronounced eye'-loo) is a system that promotes software
interoperability via interfaces.  Interfaces between what? Whatever
units of program structure are desired. They could be parts of one
process, all written in the same language; they could be parts written
in different languages, sharing runtime support in one memory image;
they could be parts running in different memory images on different
machines. ILU supports a variety of languages, including Modula-3.

<dt><b>Farshad Nayeri,</b> Critical Mass, farshad@cmass.com
<p><dd><b>Building a prototype distributed object systems using
Modula-3</b> <p> The Distributed Object Management project at GTE
Laboratories has been using Modula-3 as their main programming
language for their DOM-3 prototype for more than two years, which
allowed for features similar to ILU and Obliq (See above). We have
found the Modula-3 language and the libraries to be a great boost in
our development. More recently we developed <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.gte.com/pub/dom/software/idlm3/README>idlm3</A>, an OMG
IDL translator for Modula-3. (See <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.gte.com/pub/dom/reports/NAYE93e.ps>ECOOP'94 paper</A>
for a description of DOM-3.)

<h2>Discussions</h2>

Due to lack of time we didn't get to have much of a public discussion
during the meeting. However, several of the participants did end up
at a round-table to discuss the future of Modula-3. Issues discussed
include:

<ul>

<li> <b> Modula-3 as a low-level language</b> and a competitor of C.
The idea here is to make the compiler fast enough and run-time
footprint small enough that Modula-3 could compete favorably against
C. For example, if you only program an unsafe code that doesn't
require garbage collection, can the garbage collector be excluded from
the run-time?

<li> <b> Modula-3 as a high-level language</b> and a competitor of
Eiffel, Smalltalk, and Ada. "Sell" Modula-3 as a high-level language
that helps you write more robust code faster.

<li> <b>Exposure</b>. Modula-3 is not mentioned that much (ever?) in
most computer media. How can we change this?

<li> <b>Commercial Support</b>. You know the drill: many managers and
companies have trouble supporting the change over to a language that
does not have commercial support.  Having a big name compiler vendor
behind Modula-3 would be ideal for some, but this seems quite
unlikely at the moment.

</ul>

<hr>
<H2>What Is Modula-3?</H2> 
    
Modula-3 is a modular programming language; while preserving a safe
type system, Modula-3 provides facilities for exception handling,
concurrency, object-oriented programming, automatic garbage
collection, and systems programming, making it both a practical
implementation language for large software projects and an
excellent teaching language. An implementation of Modula-3 is
available freely from Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems
Research Center.
