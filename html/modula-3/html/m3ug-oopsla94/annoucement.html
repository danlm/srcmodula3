<H1>Modula-3 User Group Meeting at OOPSLA '94</H1>
<HR>

<p>You are cordially invited to a meeting of the Modula-3 User Group
   at OOPSLA'94, in Portland, Oregon. This meeting is open to all
   interested parties, especially Modula-3 users and others interested
   in learning more about Modula-3.

<p><H2>Please post!</h2>

<p>   The user group meeting will include presentations on what people
   are doing with Modula-3 in various organizations, including:

<h1>Presentations</h1>

<dt><b>Geoff Wyant</b>,
Sun Microsystems Laboratories, geoff.wyant@sun.com
<p>
<dd><em>Modula-3 at Sun Microsystems Laboratories</em>

<p> The Vantage Project at Sun Microsystems Laboratories is
investigating structuring and reliability mechanisms for very large
distributed object systems. Modula-3 is the principal implementation
language for the project.  The project has built several protocols on
top of Modula-3 Network Objects, and is building some tools for
programming with Network Objects, among which are IDLNO, an OMG
translator for Modula-3 Network Objects, and CM3, a tool for easy
integration of C clients of Modula-3 libraries.
(See <A HREF="slides-Sun.ps">Geoff's slides</a>.)<p>

<dt><b>Luca Cardelli</b>, Digital Systems Research Center, luca@src.dec.com
<p>
<dd><em>Obliq and Visual Obliq</em>
<p>
Obliq is a lexically-scoped untyped interpreted
language that supports distributed object-oriented computation.  An
Obliq computation may involve multiple threads of control within an
address space, multiple address spaces on a machine, heterogeneous
machines over a local network, and multiple networks over the
Internet.  Obliq objects have state and are local to a site. Obliq
computations can roam over the network, while maintaining network
connections.

Quick Start</A>, or <A

<dt><b>Eliot Moss</b>,
University Of Massachusetts at Amherst, moss@cs.umass.edu
<p>
<dd><em>History and status of UMass work on Modula-3 compilers</em>


<p> Object Systems Laboratory of UMass at Amherst have been working on
various aspects of Modula-3 implementations, including support for
advanced garbage collection and persistence mechanisms for several
years. 
<p>

<dt><b>Steve Freeman</b>, Xerox Grenoble, France, steve.freeman@xerox.fr
<p><dd><em>Adding video
capabilities to Trestle/Modula-3</em>

<p>VideoVBT is the integration of digital video into Trestle, an
object-oriented user interface toolkit written in Modula-3. The
display of video frames is managed within the application process
using, where possible, shared memory to transmit images to the window
system. VideoVBT takes advantage of Modula-3's type system,
lightweight threads and garbage collection to develop a flexible
architecture that supports the reuse of image data within an
application; the object-oriented features of Modula-3 we found most
useful were inheritance, partial revelations, and encapsulation.
VideoVBT is also integrated into several higher-level tools, such as
FormsVBT (a user interface management system) and Obliq (a distributed
scripting language; see above) which allow us to dynamically
experiment with video applications.

<p><dd><em>Inter-Language Unification</em> 

<p> ILU (pronounced eye'-loo) is a system that promotes software
interoperability via interfaces.  Interfaces between what? Whatever
units of program structure are desired. They could be parts of one
process, all written in the same language; they could be parts written
in different languages, sharing runtime support in one memory image;
they could be parts running in different memory images on different
machines. ILU supports a variety of languages, including Modula-3.

<dt><b>Farshad Nayeri,</b> Critical Mass, farshad@cmass.com
<p><dd><em>Building a prototype distributed object systems using
Modula-3</em> <p> The Distributed Object Management project at GTE
Laboratories has been using Modula-3 as their main programming
language for their DOM-3 prototype for more than two years, which
allowed for features similar to ILU and Obliq (See above). We have
found the Modula-3 language and the libraries to be a great boost in
our development. More recently we developed <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.gte.com/pub/dom/software/idlm3/README>idlm3</A>, an OMG
IDL translator for Modula-3. (See <A
HREF=ftp://ftp.gte.com/pub/dom/reports/NAYE93e.ps>ECOOP'94 paper</A>
for a description of DOM-3.)

<h1>What Is Modula-3?</h1>
    Modula-3 is a simple, modular programming language. While
    preserving a type-safe model, Modula-3 provides facilities for
    exception handling, concurrency, object-oriented programming,
    automatic garbage collection, and systems programming, making it
    both a practical implementation language for large software
    projects and an excellent teaching language. An implementation of
    Modula-3 is available freely from Digital Equipment Corporation's
    Systems Research Center.
