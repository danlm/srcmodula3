<H2>Release history</H2>
<P>

Here's a brief description of the releases:
<P>

<B>Version 3.5.3</B> fixes bugs, includes a working version of
the RS6000/AIX boostrap and has a version of the HP/PA bootstrap
that works with the current gcc 2.6.3 backend.  Also included
in this release is support for PEX-based 3-D graphics and animation.
The debugger, m3gdb, can handle floating-point literals and
many more builtin functions.  A mostly-working version of Trestle
on Windows is included.
<P>

<B>Version 3.5.2</B> fixes minor bugs.
<P>

<B>Version 3.5.1</B> fixes minor installation glitches
and includes a Modula-3 version of m3zume.
<P>

<B>Version 3.5</B> fixes several minor installation glitches
and upgrades the gcc-based backend from version 2.5.7 to 2.6.3.
This version also includes untested support for Linux with ELF
object files and shared libraries, support for ``stable objects'',
and Sil, an example of native Windows programming in Modula-3.
<P>

<B>Version 3.4</B> includes new ports to PCs running Windows/NT or
FreeBSD (1.1.5 or 2.0) and SGI/MIPS boxes running IRIX5.2.  The Windows/NT port
does not include Trestle.  The driver program, m3, and the first
pass of the compiler were merged into a single process.  Hence,
the driver maintains a cache of parsed and typechecked interfaces
for the duration of a build.
<P>

<B>Version 3.3</B> fixes several bugs in the 3.2 installation scripts.
This release includes <EM>Visual Obliq</EM>, a system for rapidly prototyping
distributed applications.
<P>

<B>Version 3.2</B> is mostly bug fixes for 3.1.  The new implementations
of <TT>Fmt</TT> and <TT>Lex</TT> are included.  A mail and news reading
program, <EM>Postcard</EM>, is included.
A new
<A HREF="../../m3sources/html/COPYRIGHT.html">license agreement/copyright
notice</A> is attached to this version.  The new license allows commercial
use of SRC Modula-3 with very few restrictions.
<P>

<B>Version 3.1</B> is the first version of the native-code world
that should build and install on some platforms.  The following
platforms should work out of the box: <TT>DS3100</TT>, <TT>ALPHA_OSF</TT>,
and <TT>LINUX</TT>.  These platforms have had an initial round of bug fixes,
but may still have problems: <TT>SPARC</TT>, <TT>HPPA</TT>,
and <TT>IBMR2</TT>.
All other platforms are untested.
<P>

A more detailed list of changes includes:
<UL>
<LI>The compiler has a new internal interface between the front-end and
the back-end, M3CG.  This interface is supposed to be easy to
implement.

<LI>The front-end can compute in the target arithmetic system; in particular
it is possible to cross-compile to machines with larger integers than
the host.

<LI>One back-end has been implemented on top of gcc.  The implementation of
M3CG interface generates the tree representation used internally in gcc.
From the gcc point of view, this back-end looks like a new front-end.
Using this back-end, we have cross-compiled solitaire for mips, alpha and
386 processors; there is no reason to believe that there would be a
problem for the other architectures supported by gcc.

<LI>Prof. Dave Hanson from Princeton wrote another implementation of the
M3CG that is
self-contained. He is currently working on the 386 code generation (he
has done the mips code generation already).

<LI>Gdb has been modified to understand Modula-3 debugging information
produced by the back-ends.  gdb can now parse Modula-3 expressions, print
Modula-3 values and evaluate some of the Modula-3 built-in operations.
There is also a little bit of support for multi-threaded programs (you
can look at the stacks of other threads).

<LI>There is a replacement for m3make, m3build, that does not rely on
cpp/awk/sed/make and what not, and removes some of the limitations of
m3make.  m3makefiles are very similar.

<LI>libm3 has been significantly changed by the Interface Police, mostly in
the area of OS interfaces and data structures.

<LI>For the OS interfaces, we still have the U* interfaces, but applications
are not supposed to use those.  Instead they should use a new set of
interfaces that are os-independent; for example, there is a Pathname
interface that manipulates file names; there is a Process interface that
manipulate child processes.  These interfaces enabled a prototype port
of the C based version to Windows NT machines.

<LI>For the data structures, generics have been introduced and the various
data structures are more consistent.

<LI>Because of m3build and the new OS interfaces, we can think about
porting to OSes other than Unix.
In particular a Windows NT port will be available at some point.

<LI>The runtime has been improved quite a bit.

<LI>New platforms: Alpha running OSF/1, 386 running Linux.  We will pay
more attention to the porting instructions and support.

<LI>I am not sure about all the changes in the libraries other than
libm3.  I suspect that there will be few changes in trestle, but that
mentor changed quite a bit.

<LI>The Windows NT port uses native threads.  This should be a good model
for other implementations of Thread using native threads.

<LI>Also included are <EM>Network Objects</EM>, a tool to aid in building
distributed systems, and <EM>Obliq</EM>, a small statically-scoped,
untyped, object-oriented, higher-order, concurrent, distributed 
and embeddable language.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Version 3.0</B> is the first public release of the native-code
compiler, new libraries, a new build tool <TT>m3build</TT>, and full symbolic
debugger <TT>m3gdb</TT>.  This release does not build or install properly.
It's primarily intended for brave pioneers and curious browsers.
<P>

<B>Version 2.11</B> is the first public release of the <TT>FormsVBT</TT>
window toolkit and the <TT>Zeus</TT> animation system.
<P>

<B>Version 2.10</B> includes a port to the <TT>HP/PA</TT> and <TT>SUN 386i</TT>
architectures and many improvements to the <TT>IBM RS/6000</TT> port.
<P>

<B>Version 2.0</B> implements the twelve language changes (i.e. generics,
IEEE floating point interfaces, ...) that are included in
<A HREF="bib.html#SPwM3">SPwM3</A>.
Version stamp checking was moved into the <TT>m3</TT>
driver, which also supports <TT>-make</TT> mode and generates enough type
declarations to make debugging tolerable.  The compiler internals were
rearranged and many bugs were removed.  Better code is produced.
<P>

<B>Version 1.6</B> fixes many bugs that have been reported.
It also introduces the <TT>SUN3</TT>, <TT>UMAX</TT> and <TT>ARM</TT>
architectures.  Some Unix interfaces have been added or modified
(<TT>Usocket</TT>, <TT>Udir</TT>, <TT>Uexec</TT>, <TT>Uerror</TT>).
The names in the
<TT>Rd</TT> and <TT>Wr</TT> interfaces are now more coherent. The new
<TT>Pkl</TT> interface allow input/output of binary data structures.  The
runtime has been rewritten to be mostly in Modula-3; this allows for
clean interfaces to the runtime; some limitations have been removed
(profiling; scheduling).  The driver has been rewritten, so as to
support shared libraries (on <TT>IBMR2</TT>, by default);
the syntax of some options has changed.
<P>

<B>Version 1.5</B> supports five new architectures (<TT>AP300</TT>,
<TT>AIX386</TT>, <TT>IBMR2</TT>, <TT>IBMRT</TT> and <TT>HP300</TT>). The driver
has been modified to improve portability of user systems. The
SRC Modula-3 libraries have been reorganized, and of course known bugs
have been fixed. New demonstration programs and games are included.
<P>

<B>Version 1.4</B> is the second public release of SRC Modula-3.
It uses the new features of version 1.3 and was alpha-tested by
several SRC clients.  This version added <TT>&lt;*UNUSED*&gt;</TT> and
<TT>&lt;*OBSOLETE*&gt;</TT> pragmas, simplified coverage profiling by
having the compiler directly generate the counters, reduced the number of
<TT>#line</TT> directives in the generated C, added ``map'' procedures so that
the garbage collector can efficiently locate global references, packed
enumerations into smaller C types, and fixed several bugs.
<P>

<B>Version 1.3</B> is for internal use only.  This version serves to
snapshot the massive editing that has taken place since 1.2.  This
version fixed the variable renaming problems, made <TT>TEXT</TT> a
<TT>REF ARRAY OF CHAR</TT>, converted the text implementation to Modula-3,
passed nested procedures as closures, used C initialization where
possible for constants and variables, added warning messages, and
fixed many bugs.
<P>

<B>Version 1.2</B>
<P>

Thanks to the new technology introduced in 1.1, porting the compiler
to other machines is much easier.  We have ported it to DECstation~3100
running Ultrix~3.1. A few bugs have been fixed.  The driver processes
the options <TT>-D</TT> and <TT>-B</TT> in a slightly different way.
<P>

The installation procedure is new, and we no longer furnish
executables as the intermediate C files are present on the release. 
Because the intermediate C files vary according to the target machine,
there are separate <TT>tar</TT> files for each of the supported machines.
However, each distribution contains all of the sources; only the intermediate
C files differ.
<P>

<B>Version 1.1</B>
<P>

This version is for internal use only. The main difference with
Version 1.0 is the use of <TT>rcs</TT> and the use of <TT>imake</TT>
rather than the standard <TT>make</TT>.
<P>

<B>Version 1.0</B>
<P>

This version is the first public release of the SRC Modula-3 system. It
contains a Modula-3 compiler and runtime, a core library, a coverage
analyzer, a dependency checker, a Modula-3 pretty printer, and a small
test suite of Modula-3 programs.  The compiler generates C as an
intermediate code.
<P>

It is known to run on VAX Ultrix 3.1.  We have not tested the software
in any other configurations.  The software may function correctly on
other versions of Ultrix, and if recompiled, may even work on other
machines.
