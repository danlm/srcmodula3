ANNOUNCEMENT
------------

We have the pleasure to announce that the  newest release of M3PC-Klagenfurt
is immediately available on the gatekeeper!

What is M3PC-Klagenfurt ?
--------------------------

   M3PC-Klagenfurt  (previously called M3PC)  is  a  port  of  the  Modula-3
   compiler release 2.09 to the MSDOS-PC.

   It translates Modula-3 source into C soure. Therefore you have to install
   the GNU C-compiler DJGPP as well,  which is distributed, too (see 4). You
   may of course  use a newer  release of the  GNU C-compiler  or additional
   compatible libraries.



What's new ?
-------------

   The new M3PC-Klagenfurt release supports the following (new) features:

          * library to access DOS files and directories
          * threads
          * pickles
          * a shell
            (incl. automatic compilation and UNIX like long filenames)


Hard- and Software Requirements
--------------------------------

   (a) Hardware:
       You will need a PC:
           *  80486 or 80386 with floatingpoint-coprocessor,
           *  at least 4 but preferable 8 MByte of RAM,
           *  20 MByte disk space free at least.

   (b) Software:
           * DOS 5.00 or higher


Necessary Files for Installation
---------------------------------

   The necessary  files  are  available  at  "gatekeeper.dec.com"  in  the
   directory "pub/DEC/Modula-3/contrib/m3pc":

              TAR      EXE        39,353 11-07-94  10:11a
              INSTALL  TXT         5,325 11-10-94   4:57p
              M3       TAR     6,799,360 11-07-94   4:26p
              DJGPP    TAR     6,809,600 11-07-94  11:33a
              M3SRC    TAR     6,871,040 11-07-94  11:36a
              README               5,331 11-10-94   5:40p



For further details please see the files README and INSTALL.TXT.


What is still to come?
-----------------------

A  student-friendly environment  with integrated  editor-browser-compiler
is in the test-phase and should be shipped in course of March.
The main purpose of the system is to provide an environment for beginners
and hide unnecessary details of the operating system and run-time support.

It will also be the basis of the examples of the book
"Programming in style -- An introduction into programming with Modula-3"
which is also intended first of all for first- and second-semester
computer science students.

Subject: M3 pn PC

The Modula-3 system ported by us on the PC and available on the
gatekeeper, runs with MSDOS, gnu c compiler and djgpp memory
manager (detailed description in the read me file).

The first version was ported by Klaus Preschern. Carsten Weich rewrote
the handling of long filenames for the second version.

You may compile, link and run Modula-3 programs, without threads.
From the library modules only those are tested which are used by
the compiler.  We are using the actual version for our beginners-course
and we are working on "student-friendly" programming environmnents and
a simple windowing graphic-library.

Subject: New version of Modula-3/PC
Date: 28 Jan 1994 13:25:28 GMT

We have built a new version of Modula-3 running on a PC.
You will need a PC:
  *  80486 or 80386 with floatingpoint-coprocessor,
  *  at least 4 but preferable 8 MByte of RAM,
  *  20 MByte discspace free at least.

You can run a modified Modula-3 version 2.09 without thread-
support. Our version features:
  *  support for Unix-like long filenames
  *  automatic compilation (to substitute the lack of m3make)
  *  library to access DOS-files and directories.

We have built a little shell which translates the long filenames you
type in into DOS-filenames. It has a unix-lookalike "ls"-command.
There are commands to teach the system new long filenames.
You can savely move such files around through DOS-directories
(which was not possible with the first version).

This version accesses DOS-files significantly faster than the first
version. Especially linking large Modula-3 programs is much faster
now. On a 50 MHz 80486 with 16 MByte of RAM we measured
a turn-around time of 2 minutes for a 5 module, 500 lines program.
If you want to compile only one module you will have to wait
about one minute.

The necessary files are available at "gatekeeper.dec.com" in
/pub/DEC/Modula-3/contrib/m3pc:

   Install.txt   please read this first!
   djgpp.tar     the DJGPP-gnu-C-compiler
   m3.tar        compiler binaries
   m3src.tar     sources of the compiler (optional)
   tar.exe       program to unpack these files
