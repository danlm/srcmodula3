<H2>Implementation restrictions</H2>
<P>

With a few exceptions, SRC Modula-3 implements the Modula-3 language as
defined in ``<A HREF="bib.html#SPwM3">Systems Programming with Modula-3</A>''.
<P>

<H3>Arithmetic checking</H3>
<P>

SRC Modula-3 does not generate any special checking for integer arithmetic
overflow or underflow.  You get whatever checking <TT>gcc</TT> gives you.
Depending on your machine, the
<A HREF="../../m3sources/html/float/src/IEEE-default/FloatMode.i3.html"><TT>FloatMode</TT></A>
interface may be used to control floating point exceptions.
<P>

<H3>Packed types</H3>
<P>

Packed types are restricted.  The compiler enforces the rule that every scalar
field (packed or unpacked) can be loaded by a simple ``load, shift, and mask''
sequence on the machine.  So, for example, its not possible to
have a 32-bit integer that crosses a 32-bit alignment boundary
on a machine which only supports aligned 32-bit loads.
<P>

<H3>Stack overflow checking</H3>
<P>

SRC Modula-3 does not reliably detect thread stack overflows.  Stacks
are only checked for overflow on procedure entry.  No checking is done
on external procedures.  Thread stacks are allocated in fixed size
chunks.  The required
<A HREF="../../m3sources/html/thread/src/Common/Thread.i3.html"><TT>Thread</TT></A>
interface has been augmented with
the <TT>SizedClosure</TT> type to allow arbitrary sized stacks. The default
size can be adjusted with <TT>Thread.MinDefaultStackSize</TT> and
<TT>Thread.IncDefaultStackSize</TT>.
<P>

<H3>Exception semantics</H3>
<P>

On some platforms (<TT>ALPHA_OSF</TT> and <TT>DS3100</TT>), exceptions scopes
are delimited by tables of PCs and exceptions are dispatched by a
runtime routine that's able to unwind the stack.  If you can implement
a stack walker for your machine, send us the code.
(See <TT>libm3/src/runtime/*/RTExceptionC.c</TT> for examples.)
<P>

On all other platforms,
SRC Modula-3 uses C's <TT>setjmp</TT>/<TT>longjmp</TT> mechanism to
unwind the stack when raising an exception.  A problem can
occur:  assignments may appear to be undone.
For example, consider
<PRE>
    TRY
      i := 3;
      P ();
    EXCEPT E:
      j := i;
    END;
</PRE>
where <TT>P</TT> raises exception <TT>E</TT>.
The compiler generates a <TT>setjmp</TT> at the beginning of
the try statement.  If the C compiler allocates variable <TT>i</TT>
to a register, the assignment of <TT>3</TT> may be lost during the
<TT>longjmp</TT> and branch that gets to the handler.
<P>

<H3>Method constants</H3>
<P>

The language definition says that if <TT>T</TT> is an object type
and <TT>m</TT> one of its methods, <TT>T.m</TT> denotes the procedure
value that implements that method and that this value is a constant.
In SRC Modula-3, <TT>T.m</TT> denotes the correct procedure constant,
but since the compiler generates runtime code to locate the method,
some uses of the constant that the <TT>C</TT> compiler must resolve at link
time will cause <TT>C</TT> errors.
For example,
<PRE>
    CONST P = T.m;  BEGIN P (...) ...
</PRE>
will work, since no initialized <TT>C</TT> storage is allocated for <TT>P</TT>.
But the following generates initialized storage and will fail
<PRE>
    CONST X = ARRAY [0..2] OF Proc { T.m, ..};
</PRE>
<P>

Similarly, although Modula-3 allows it, the following cannot be
evaluated at compile time
<PRE>
    CONST X = (T.m = MyProcedure);
</PRE>
<P>
