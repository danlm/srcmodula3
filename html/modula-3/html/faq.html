<A NAME="a1"><HR><H2>The language</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a1.1"><H3>What is Modula-3?</H3></A>
<P>

Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa,
Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.  It also resembles its cousins
Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
<P>

The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
meeting the needs of modern systems programmers.  Instead of
exploring new features, we studied the features of the Modula
family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and
tried to simplify them into a harmonious language.  We found that
most of the successful features were aimed at one of two main
goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more systematic type
system.
<P>

Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
provision for explicit interfaces between modules.  It adds objects
and classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight
processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.
<P>

<A NAME="a1.2"><H3>Is Modula-3 a superset of Modula-2?</H3></A>
<P>

No; valid Modula-2 programs are not valid Modula-3 programs.  However,
there is a tool to help convert Modula-2 programs to Modula-3.
<P>

<A NAME="a2"><HR><H2>The documentation</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a2.1"><H3>Where can I get a description of Modula-3?</H3></A>

The definition of Modula-3 is contained in:
<A HREF="bib.html#SPwM3">"System Programming with Modula-3"</A>
also known as <i>SPwM3</i>.
<P>

Chapters 2 and 3 have been reprinted in
<A HREF="bib.html#sigplan">Sigplan Notices</A>,
Volume 27, Number 8, August 1992, pp 15-42.
<P>

Sam Harbison has written a more tutorial book titled
<A HREF="bib.html#m3-Har92">Modula3</A>.

The errata sheet is available via anonymous ftp from
<tt>gatekeeper.dec.com</tt>
and its <A HREF="ftp.html">mirrors</A>
in <tt>pub/DEC/Modula-3/errata</tt>.
<P>

<A NAME="a2.2"><H3>Where can I get other information on Modula-3?</H3></A>
<P>

There is a Usenet newsgroup,
<A HREF="contacts.html"><b>comp.lang.modula3</b></A>.
<P>

A more extensive <A HREF="bib.html">Modula-3 bibliography</A>

<P>

<A NAME="a3"><HR><H2>The implementations</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a3.1"><H3>Where can I get an implementation?</H3></A>

PC versions,
<A HREF="m3pc.html">m3pc</A>
and
<A HREF="ex32.html">M3forDOS</A>.
<P>

Apparently work on
<A HREF="gnu-m3.html">GNU Modula-3</A>
has stopped.
<P>

As far as we know, implementations are not available for VMS or Macintosh.
<P>

<A NAME="a3.2"><H3>What is SRC Modula-3?</H3></A>

<A NAME="a3.3"><H3>What is m3pc?</H3></A>
<P>

<A HREF="m3pc.html">m3pc</A> is a port of SRC Modula-3 version 2.11
to a PC running MSDOS.

<A NAME="a3.4"><H3>What is M3forDOS?</H3></A>
<P>

<A HREF="ex32.html">M3forDOS</A> is a port of SRC Modula-3
version 3.1 to a PC running MSDOS. 
<A HREF="ex32.html">ex32</A> is the name of the DOS extender
used by that system.

<A NAME="a3.5"><H3>What is GNU Modula-3?</H3></A>
<P>

<A HREF="gnu-m3.html">GNU Modula-3</A> was an independent
implementation that was to be fully integrated with gcc.
<P>

<A NAME="a4"><HR><H2>Some specific questions</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a4.1"><H3>Why is "Hello World" so large?</H3></A>
<P>

Modula-3 programs are larger than C programs for the following reasons:
<OL>
<LI> The fixed runtime is substantially larger.  It contains a
garbage collector, a thread runtime, and exception support.
Note that "Hello World" is virtually all runtime.  For
larger programs the runtime is not an issue.

<LI> The generated code includes runtime checks for out-of-bound
array references and NIL pointer.  Many of these checks could
be removed by a better compiler.  The current compiler is
only a research prototype.

<LI> The compiler generates C code as its intermediate language
consequently the final machine code suffers.  For example,
the compiler is constantly storing single-precision floating
point values into memory to get around C's predisposition
for double precision.
</OL>

<A NAME="a4.2"><H3>Why objects and interfaces?</H3></A>
<P>

Allan Heydon on <tt>comp.lang.modula3</tt>,  May 4th 1993:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Modula-3 provides two separate mechanisms for data-hiding: one for 
hiding details about how interfaces are implemented, and the other 
for hiding details about how objects are implemented.
<P>

The first data-hiding mechanism is realized by the distinction between 
interfaces and modules. Clients can only import interfaces, so the 
names declared in the modules implementing those interfaces are hidden 
from clients. Note that this mechanism has only two levels; a name 
is either declared in an interface, or it isn't. If a name is only 
declared in a module, it can't be used by a client. 
<P>

The second data-hiding mechanism is realized by opaque types and 
revelations. A Modula-3 interface may declare an object type to be 
opaque, in which case only a subset of the fields and methods of 
that object are revealed to clients importing the interface. Furthermore, 
the Modula-3 revelation mechanism allows a designer to reveal successively 
more fields and methods of an object in a series of interfaces. The 
fields and methods visible to a client then depends on which interfaces 
the client imports. 
<P>

The latter mechanism is quite flexible. As opposed to the interface/module 
data-hiding mechanism, opaque types allow you to define an arbitrary 
number of levels at which more and more information about the implementation 
of your object is revealed. 
<P>

See Sections 2.2.10, 2.4.6, and 2.4.7 of "Systems Programming with 
Modula-3" for more information about opaque types and about partial 
and complete revelations.

<P>

<A NAME="a4.3"><H3>What is the story with Trestle and OpenWindows?</H3></A>
<P>

Mark Manasse says: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think that the OpenWindows release should be enough (no need to 
get the MIT X release], although there are a few things in Trestle
that trigger devastating bugs in OpenWindows. But the only library
we depend on is Xlib, R4 or later.
<P>

The main thing I know that crashes OW 2.0 is the code where we call 
GrabKey specifying AnyKey.  You can either loop over all of the 
keys, or you can just comment out the call; programs won't run exactly 
the same, but you probably won't notice the difference.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME="a4.4"><H3>When is the next release of SRC Modula-3?</H3></A>
<P>

The next release will be called 3.5.4 (or 3.6).  At this time there is no
scheduled release date.
<P>

<A NAME="a5"><HR><H2>FTP</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a5.1"><H3>What if I don't have ftp access?</H3></A>

Unfortunately, we cannot deliver Modula-3 other than by 
anonymous ftp.  
<P>

Fortunately, Prime Time Freeware (PTF) includes Modula-3.  PTF is
a set of two ISO-9660 CDroms filled with 3GB of freeware, issued
semi-annually.  The latest issue, Volume 1, Number 2, July 1992,
contains SRC Modula-3 2.07.  PTF is distributed via bookstores and
mail.  You can reach PTF using:

<A NAME="a6"><HR><H2>Contributing</H2></A>
<P>

<A NAME="a6.1"><H3>Can I contribute Modula-3 software?</H3></A>
<P>

Certainly.  Send us what you are willing to share, be it programs,
libraries or other things.  We'll put them in the distribution.
<P>

Right now, the <tt>pub/DEC/Modula-3/contrib</tt> directory contains:
<PRE>
    m3rpc     an rpc system from Xerox Parc
    M2toM3    a translator from Modula-2 to Modula-3
    m3pc      an implementation of Modula-3 (v2.11) for PCs
    M3forDOS  an implementation of Modula-3 (v3.1) for PCs.
