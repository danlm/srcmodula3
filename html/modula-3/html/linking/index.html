<H2>The Linker's Inclusion Algorithm</H2>
<P>

When you build a program package or library package that imports one
or more library packages, the interfaces you IMPORT from within those
imported packages must be visible. However, there are other
requirements you must satisfy when building a program.<P>

The Modula-3 language definition defines a complete <I>program</I> to
be "a collection of modules and interfaces that contains every
interface imported or exported by any of its modules or interfaces,
and in which no procedure, module, or interface is multiply defined"
(Section 2.5, page 42). There are other requirements on a complete
program as well. For example, every declared procedure must have an
implementation, and every opaque type must have a concrete
revelation.<P>

When you build a program that imports library packages, not all of the
interfaces and modules in those libraries are necessarily included by
the linker. In fact, only those interfaces and modules that satisfy a
<I>reachability requirement</I> are linked into the final program.<P>
