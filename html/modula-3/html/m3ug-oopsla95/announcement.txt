You are cordially invited to a meeting of the Modula-3 User Group at
OOPSLA'95, in Austin, Texas.

This meeting is open to all, especially current users  and others 
interested in learning more about Modula-3! Our meeting will include 
presentations on what people are do with Modula-3 in various organizations.  

- Craig Chambers & Jeff Dean of University of Washington will describe
  their work on applying advanced optimizations to Modula-3 programs
  as part of the Vortex project.

- Allan Heydon of DEC Systems Research Center will present Juno-2, an
  extensible constraint-based drawing package written in Modula-3.
   
- Blair MacIntyre of Columbia University will persent his prototype
  augmented reality system written using Modula-3 Network Objects.

- Lauren Schmitt of Critical Mass Inc will unveil Photon, a
  programming environment written for Modula-3.

We also hope to cover a variety of topics about Modula-3 such as:
ports to PC OSs  (Win/NT, Win'95, OS/2, Linux), evangelizing, commercial 
use, academic and research use, and  distributed applications with 
Modula-3. 

Please join us!

WHAT IS MODULA-3?

Modula-3 is a simple and modular programming language, providing
facilities  for exception handling, concurrency,  object-oriented 
programming, automatic garbage collection, a nd systems programming 
without involving the  complexities forced by other  languages of 
its class. Modula-3 is both a practical  implementation language  
for large software projects and an excellent teaching  language. 

An implementation of Modula-3 is available free of charge from
Digital Systems Research Center.
