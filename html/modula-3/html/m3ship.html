<H2>m3ship</H2>
<P>

<EM>m3ship</EM>
will ship all the build directories (for different architectural
variants) that exist in the package.  It will refuse to ship anything if 
it finds a variant that was built with "overrides", unless the "-k" option 
is given, in which case it will ship all the variants except those that
were built with overrides.
<P>

The syntax for invoking <B>m3ship</B> is
<PRE>
     m3ship [options]
</PRE>
<P>

The following options are interpreted by <B>m3ship</B>.
<UL>

<LI> <B>-k</B>
Don't generate an error message if any of the .M3SHIP files are
missing.  Keep on going.
<P>

<LI> <B>-b</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Use the  <I>dir</I> configuration and ship from the directory named <I>dir</I>.
The default directory is configured into m3ship when
it is installed.
<P>

<LI> <B>-d</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Change the current directory to <I>dir</I>
before doing anything.
<P>

<LI> <B>-S</B>
Ship derived objects regardless of the current directory's name.
Normally, if the current working directory is <B>src</B>, <B>m3ship</B>
will refuse to build derived objects in it.
<P>

<LI> <B>-v</B>
Be verbose, i.e. echo the
<A HREF="quake/quake.html">quake</A> comand before executing it.
<P>

<LI> <B>-T</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Read templates from <I>dir</I>
instead of the default location.  The new directory
must include the full set of templates (e.g. COMMON, PLATFORMS).
</UL>
<P>

And finally, any other arguments that begin with a "-" are passed on to
<A HREF="quake/quake.html">quake</A>.
A couple that may be useful are:
<UL>

<LI> <B>-n</B>
Operations that invoke external programs, e.g. the Modula-3 compiler,
are processed but the external programs are not executed.
<P>

<LI> <B>-V</B>
This option causes all the directories in which <TT>m3makefiles</TT> are
read to be echoed to the standard output. It can be helpful in
debugging a complex package structure.
</UL>
