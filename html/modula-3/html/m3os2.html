<H2>OS/2 3.5.3: an implementation of SRC Modula-3 for OS/2</H2>

<P> <A HREF="mailto:klausp@ping.at">Klaus Preschern</A> has ported SRC
Modula-3 version 3.5.3 to the OS/2 operating system. He has used
his port to compile the Modula-3 compiler itself on OS/2 version 2.11
and he has tested in on OS/2 Warp (version 3.0).

<P> Carsten Whimster has written an article, <A
HREF="http://www.iqpac.com/edm2/articles/039604x.shtml">"Using
Modula-3 Under OS/2"</A>, that describes how to retrieve and install
the Modula-3 port for OS/2. The article is published in
<A HREF="http://www.iqpac.com/edm2/index.shtml">EDM/2</A>, the
Electronic Development Magazine, OS/2 edition.

<P> Carsten's article provides the most comprehensive information on
installing the OS/2 port, but here are two posts that were made to the
<TT>comp.lang.modula3</TT> newsgroup in mid-November, 1995, related to
the port and how to obtain the binaries. These posts have been edited
slightly for clarity.

Subject: M3 for OS/2 available!

Hi folks,

I do not know whether the Modula-3 compiler is already available for OS/2.
Several times I have seen messages from people working on such a port -
but I have never seen an announcement of Modula-3 for OS/2 (possibly I
missed it?). Anyway, I have started my own port; here is some
information about it:

- The M3 compiler (V3.5.3) does work under OS/2. I have successfully
  compiled it with itself under OS/2 2.11 and tested it with 3.0 (Warp).
  HPFS (long file names) required with approx. 30 MB free disk space.

- The following packages are available: m3core, libm3, m3middle,
  m3linker, m3objfile, m3front, m3back, m3staloneback, m3.
  Furthermore I have m3build, m3ship, m3where, quake and m3mkdir.

- The port does use the GNU backend (m3cgc1) - I have translated
  the WinNT backend, but do not use it currently.

- The port is based on emx V0.9a and gcc V2.6.3. The M3 OS/2 target
  is therefore very close to the LINUX target.

- Not available (in other words, the to-do-list):
  - no support for threads
  - no support for DLLs (I build Unix libs --> biiiiiig executables)
  - no Trestle
  - no network objects (not tried)

If somebody is interested in my current state, I can put it on a ftp
server (please let me know where).

Subject: Modula3 for OS2

As he announced yesterday, Klaus Preschern suceeded in porting SRC
Modula-3 to OS/2. This way, people having access to OS/2 machines will
be able to fine tune the run time (threads) and port the graphical
interface (Trestle) to presentation manager.

Klaus Preschern downloaded his port to my site yesterday and it is now
available:
