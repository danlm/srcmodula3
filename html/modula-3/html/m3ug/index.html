The fourth Modula-3 users group meeting was held Tuesday,
17-Oct-95, at the OOPSLA '95 conference in Austin, Texas. There
were about 30 people in attendence.<P>

This year's meeting was organized by
<A HREF="mailto:farshad@cmass.com">Farshad Nayeri</A> and
<A HREF="mailto:gwyant@cloyd.east.sun.com">Geoff Wyant</A>.
Contact either of them if you have any questions or are
interested in future Modula-3 users group meetings. The

meeting is available on-line.<P>

<H2>Presentations</H2>

Here is a list of speakers and a summary of what they
presented:

<DT>
<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/staff/heydon/bio.html"><B>Allan Heydon</B></A> -
<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/home.html">Digital
Systems Research Center (SRC)</A>
<DD>
<P>
Allan discussed two topics: the status of Modula-3 at SRC, and
the Juno-2 constraint-based drawing editor
<A HREF="#Juno-2">[1]</A>.<P>

The status of Modula-3 at SRC has changed recently because Bill
Kalsow, the implementor of the SRC Modula-3 compiler, has left
SRC for family reasons to live in Minnesota. But Modula-3 is
still in use at SRC, and the SRC Modula-3 compiler has been
stable and correctly compiling millions of lines of code for
quite a while. Although active development within SRC of the
Modula-3 development environment will cease, we are still
answering <A HREF="mailto:m3-request@src.dec.com"><TT>m3-request</TT></A>
mail, incorporating bug fixes and enhancements submitted by outside
users, coordinating external efforts to port SRC Modula-3 to other
platforms, and making new releases of the system.<P>

Allan also gave a brief demonstration of Juno-2, a
constraint-based drawing editor that he implemented with Greg
Nelson. Juno-2 is written entirely in Modula-3. The demo was
given on a Pentium-based laptop running LINUXELF. For more
information on Juno-2, see the
<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com:80/SRC/juno-2/">Juno-2
Home Page</A> and the article on the
<A HREF="http://www.cmass.com/threads/1/threads.html#feature">Juno-2
user interface</A> in the
<A HREF="http://www.cmass.com/threads/1/threads.html">first issue</A> of
<A HREF="http://www.cmass.com/threads">Threads</A>, the Modula-3
newsletter.<P>

<DT>
<A HREF="http://ftp.cs.columbia.edu:80/~bm/"><B>Blair MacIntyre</B></A> -
<A HREF="http://ftp.cs.columbia.edu:80/">Columbia University</A>
<DD>
<P>
Blair gave a demonstration of his "augmented reality" system.
Wearing a head-mounted display that reports three degrees of
freedom (pitch, roll, and yaw), he showed a simple application
in which the user is situated at the center of a compass, and
various cities in the application's database appear as pyramids
at the correct compass points (this is possible because the
yaw value reported by the head-mounted display is an actual
compass measurement).<P>

The system is implemented in Modula-3 and
<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/Obliq/Obliq.html">Obliq</A>,
giving the programmer a toolkit that provides language-level
support for building distributed virtual environments. The
programmer can implement their applications in Obliq, Modula-3
or any combination thereof since all toolkit objects (such as
trackers and graphical objects) are accessible from both
languages. Data distribution is almost entirely transparent,
encouraging the programmer to make heavy use of threads
communicating via shared objects.<P>

His system is based on the distributed data-object paradigm for
distributed shared memory. He implemented a <TT>SharedObj</TT>
package, similar in flavour to Modula-3
<A HREF="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/abstracts/src-rr-115.html">Network Objects</A>,
which allows any data object to be declared as a shared object
that is replicated fully in any process that is interested in
it. These shared objects support asynchronous data propagation
with atomic serializable updates, and asynchronous notification
of updates. To accomplish this, he relied on existing Modula-3
packages, especially Network Objects and

<DT>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jdean/"><B>Jeff Dean</B></A> -
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</A>
<DD>
<P>
Jeff reported on the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/">Cecil/Vortex</A>
work going on at the University of Washington to improve the
performance of object-oriented programs through whole-program
analysis <A HREF="#CecilGlobalOpt">[2]</A>. There was an OOPSLA
technical talk on the system earlier that day
<A HREF="#CecilReceiver">[3]</A>. Among other languages (Cecil,
C++, and Java), they are also building a Modula-3 front-end for
their Vortex compiler.<P>

<DT>
<A HREF="mailto:lps@cmass.com"><B>Lauren Schmitt</B></A> -
<A HREF="http://www.cmass.com/">Critical Mass</A>
<DD>
<P>
Lauren announced the formation of the company Critical Mass,
which will be selling commercial versions of Modula-3. Their
first product, Photon, is a development environment for
Modula-3. The first release of Photon for Linux will be
available sometime this December for $49.<P>

<DT>
<A HREF="http://froh.vlsi.polymtl.ca/dagenais/home/home.html"><B>Michel
Dagenais</B></A> - Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal
<DD>
<P>
Michel Dagenais mentioned several Modula-3 projects he and
his students have been working on:<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>LINUXELF backend (work with Jerome Collin)</B>
<DD>
<P>
Michel has recently released a native-code generator for
the LINUXELF platform. At the meeting, Farshad Nayeri showed
how quickly the backend compiled the Juno-2 application. Because
it does not have to go through the filesystem and does not use
gcc to generate code, compilers with native-code generators
(namely, the LINUXELF and NT386 platforms) run significantly
faster than other platforms. For example, a 486-based machine
running Windows NT compiles code 4 times faster than an Alpha,
even though the Alpha processor is twice as fast.<P>

Michel reports that they still have some work to do on the
LINUXELF backend:<P>

<UL>
<LI>generate position-independent code (for shared libraries)
<LI>generate debugging symbols
<LI>generate the equivalent of the current m3main.c file
directly in the back-end
</UL>
<P>

<DT><B><TT>m3build2</TT> + <TT>m3</TT> (work with Jerome Collin)</B>
<DD>
<P>
M3build2 is the name of a program that integrates the current
m3build program with the quake interpreter (used by m3build to
evaluate m3makefiles). Michel and Jerome are further integrating
m3build2 with the m3 compiler itself into a single process.<P>

As part of the M3 Lite project at SRC, Bill Kalsow had eventually
hoped to integrate all these programs and to turn them into a
server process that could cache the AST's of imported interfaces
across builds. Michel thinks that he and Jerome may go as far as
making such an M3 compiler server.<P>

<DT><B>m3tohtml and htmltolatex (with Martin Gagnom)</B>
<DD>
<P>
One nice feature of SRC Modula-3 is that interfaces are the
man pages. The current m3totex program, written by Greg Nelson,
can be used to convert a Modula-3 interface into a printed
document. Bill Kalsow wrote a program called m3browser that
serves up Modula-3 interfaces and implementations as Web pages.
One problem with this approach is that the current interfaces
contain limited amounts of embedded LaTeX code, which the
m3browser program does not know how to format.<P>

Michel and Martin are converting all the current Modula-3
interfaces to use HTML tags instead of LaTeX. They are also
implementing tools based on m3totex and m3browser.
The m3tohtml program converts a Modula-3 interface to HTML;
the htmltolatex program can then be used to produce printed
output. These tools will improve the format of the Modula-3
on-line documentation.<P>

<DT><B>Modula-3 port to OS/2 (with Louis Dominique Dubeau)</B>
<DD>
<P>
Louis is porting Modula-3 to OS/2. This does not include a port
of Trestle, the Modula-3 graphics/window system. The port should
be complete very soon.<P>

<DT><B>CanvasVBT (with Benoit Poirier)</B>
<DD>
<P>
A CanvasVBT is a Trestle window that visualizes a display list.
A display list represents a sequence of graphics operations; they
have a program for converting PostScript to this representation.
They also have a simple direct-manipulation editor for
CanvasVBT's.<P>

<DT><B>Modula-3 Development Environment for Novices</B>
<DD>
<P>
Michel has been working on customizing emacs to create a
Modula-3 environment that will be easier for novices to use.
For example, he has menu commands for:<P>

<UL>
<LI>invoking m3build (with optional profiling and coverage analysis)
<LI>running a program (with option of running showheap, shownew, etc.)
<LI>easily searching the on-line interface documentation and
    Modula-3 language definition
<LI>pretty-printing Modula-3 code
<LI>showing a FormsVBT form
</UL>
<P>

In the first two cases, the options are selected through
a GUI interface with checkboxes.<P>
