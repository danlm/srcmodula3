<H2>m3build command line options</H2>
<P>

If no target is specified, <B>all</B> is assumed.  It causes the
specified program or library to be built.  The only other
target that is supported in all
<A HREF="m3makefile.html"><TT>m3makefiles</TT></A> is <B>clean</B>
which removes any derived files created by <B>m3build all</B>.
<P>

The following options are interpreted by <TT>m3build</TT>.
<PRE>
-b dir  
       Use the <TT>dir</TT> configuration and build in the directory
       named <TT>dir</TT>.  The default build directory is configured
       into <TT>m3build</TT> when it is installed.
-d dir  
       Change the current directory to <TT>dir</TT> before doing anything.
       This option is most useful when you're editing in the <TT>src</TT>
       subdirectory and compile command you need is <TT>m3build -d ..</TT>.
-S  
       Generate derived objects regardless of the current directory's
       name.  Normally, if the current working directory is <TT>src</TT>,
       <TT>m3build</TT> will refuse to build derived objects.
-O  
       Read the <TT>m3overrides</TT> file if present.
-v  
       Be verbose, i.e. echo the <TT>quake</TT> comand before executing it.
-T dir  
       Read templates from <TT>dir</TT> instead of the default location.  The new
       directory must include the full set of templates (e.g. <TT>COMMON</TT>,
       <TT>PLATFORMS</TT>, ...).
</PRE>
<P>

And finally, any other arguments that begin with a hyphen are passed on
to <TT>quake</TT>(5).  A couple that may be useful are:
<PRE>
-n  
      Operations that invoke external programs, e.g. the Modula-3
      compiler, are processed but the external programs are not executed.
-V  
      This option causes all the directories in which <TT>m3makefile</TT>s are
      read to be echoed to the standard output. It can be helpful in
      debugging a complex package structure.
</PRE>
