<H2>Building programs and libraries </H2>
<P>

<B> library(X) </B>  
          compile the sources in the set <TT>PGM_SOURCES</TT> and build a
          library, <TT>X</TT>, from the resulting compiled object files.
          The visibility of the library is hidden.
 
<P>

<B> Library(X) </B>  
          The same as <TT>library</TT>.
 
<P>

<B> program(X) </B>  
          constructs an executable program named <TT>X</TT> from the given
          sources.
 
<P>

<B> Program(X) </B>  
          like <TT>program</TT>, but <TT>X</TT> is exported to <TT>/bin</TT>.
 
<P>

<B> build_standalone() </B>  
          ensures that the program being built does not depend on
          dynamic linking and shared libraries.  To have an effect,
          this procedure must be called before <TT>program</TT> or
          <TT>Program</TT> is called.
