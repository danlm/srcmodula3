<P>

<TT>m3makefile</TT>s are in fact
<A HREF="../quake/quake.html"><TT>quake</TT></A> programs.
<A HREF="../quake/quake.html"><TT>quake</TT></A> is an interpreter for a small, but powerful
programming language.
It's an imperative language with variables, arrays, tables, conditionals,
loops, and procedures.
The full features of that language are available if required,
but very few <TT>m3makefile</TT>s need this extra generality.
<P>

Described with
<A HREF="m3build.html">m3build</A> are the facilities (many of them programmed
in <A HREF="../quake/quake.html"><TT>quake</TT></A>) that <TT>m3build</TT> users should need.
Most <TT>m3makefile</TT>s are simply sequences of calls to
these predefined procedures.
<P>

<A HREF="../quake/quake.html">Quake</A> has one slightly quirky feature:
<EM>when evaluated, undefined variables return their names as strings</EM>.
So, <TT>module(foo)</TT> will call the
predefined <TT>module</TT> procedure and pass it the value of the variable
<TT>foo</TT>.  If <TT>foo</TT> is undefined, the string <TT>"foo"</TT> will
be passed.  If <TT>foo</TT> is defined, something else is passed.  It's
better to write <TT>module("foo")</TT> and avoid confusion.
Many of the SRC Modula-3 <TT>m3makefile</TT>s depend on this
feature.  It would be better if they didn't and we recommend that you
avoid it.
