<H2>Compiling for profiling and coverage analysis</H2>

On most Unix systems, the programs prof(1), gprof(1), and
analyze_coverage(1) can be used to profile your Modula-3 program's
performance or to analyze which source lines of your program have been
executed. However, in order to use these tools, you must compile your
program with certain compiler options.<P>

<H3>Profiling</H3>

To profile your program for use with prof(1) or gprof(1), add one of
the following <A HREF="m3options.html">compiler options</A> to your
m3makefile:<P>

<PRE>
  m3_option("-X2@-p@")     % for prof(1) profiling
  m3_option("-X2@-pg@")    % for gprof(1) profiling
</PRE>

This will cause your program to be linked for profiling. If you have
already built your program without profiling, and you want to turn
profiling on, just delete your binary and rebuild; there's no need to
recompile each of your sources or libraries, since enabling profiling
happens at link-time.<P>

When you run your program, a file named "mon.out" (for prof(1)) or
"gmon.out" (for gprof(1)) will be created. To view the profile, run
the prof(1) or gprof(1) program using the command-line:<P>

<PRE>
  prof prog mon.out
  gprof prog gmon.out
</PRE>

where <I>prog</I> is the filename of your program's binary.<P>

Unfortunately, according to one user, this recipe does not work on
Solaris- or SunOS-based platforms. If you can figure out how to get
profiling to work on either of these platforms, please let us know by
sending a message to <TT>m3-request@src.dec.com</TT>!<P>

<H3>Coverage Analysis</H3>

To determine how many times each source line and procedure of your
Modula-3 program were exececuted on a particular run, you need to
compile it to be used with the analyze_coverage(1) tool. To do
this, add the following <A HREF="m3options.html">compiler option</A>
to your <A HREF="m3makefile.html"><TT>m3makefile</TT></A>:<P>

<PRE>
  m3_option("-Z")
</PRE>

Coverage data will be available only for those modules that have been
compiled with this option, so if you want coverage analysis for all
your sources and you have just turned this option on, you will need to
delete your derived directory and recompile everything. To produce the
coverage data, you must also link your program with this option.<P>

Once you've compiled your program for coverage analysis, just run it.
By default, this will produce a file named "coverage.out" in the
current directory (you can set the environment variable
<TT>COVERAGE_DATABASE</TT> to the name of a different file if you
prefer). This file is the coverage database. The coverage information
is <I>accumulated</I> in this file from run to run, so if you want to
see what your program does on a single run, you should delete the
coverage database file before running your program. For the same
reason, the profiling data file is rather large; furthermore, as it is
augmented by each execution of the program, you may want to compress
it from time to time (see <TT>analyze_coverage(1)</TT> for more
details).<P>

Once you've run your program, you can use the analyze_coverage(1) tool
to show you what's in the coverage database. For this tool to work,
you must point it to the directories containing your source files. You
can do this by setting the <TT>COVERAGE_PATH</TT> environment
variable, or by supplying the "-S" option to analyze_coverage(1).
Again, see the analyze_coverage(1) man page for details.<P>

Note that because of the extensive data collection performed by this mode of
profiling, the execution time of the program can be significantly larger when
it is enabled; thus, simultaneous time profiling can produce erroneous
results.<P>
