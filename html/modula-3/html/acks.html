and also translated some DEC SRC Modula-2+ modules to Modula-3.
<P>

<EM>J'erome Chailloux</EM> (ILOG) developed the X interfaces while
visiting DEC SRC. We also had numerous discussions about the evolution

<P>

<EM>Chuck Thacker</EM> (DEC SRC) wrote the original version of Sil.
Bill Kalsow converted it to Modula-3.

Thanks also to all the people who used SRC Modula-3 and reported bugs.
<P>

The various ports would have been impossible without the work of a
number of people, who kindly made their modifications available.
However, most of the bugs you may find in these ports were introduced
during the final integration of these modifications and we are to be
blamed for them.
<P>
