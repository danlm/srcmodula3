<H2>Finding objects and libraries</H2>
<P>

Objects and libraries are linked together by the driver to
produce an executable program.  These modules may be divided into
three classes: (1) objects that are produced by the compiler as
a result of a compilation; (2) objects that are specified on
the compiler command line by the user; (3) libraries.
<P>

The driver needs to know where to get these files to create a
command line for the linker.  It knows where type (1) objects are
(since it created them). Type (2) objects must be fully specified
either as absolute or relative paths.  Libraries can be specified 
either by their full names or using the <B>-L</B>/<B>-l</B>
combination.
<P>

<B>m3</B> does not have a built-in default search path for libraries.
The search path provided by
<A HREF="../m3build/m3build.html">m3build</A>
contains the standard SRC Modula-3 libraries.
<P>

When linking a program, <B>m3</B>
adds a built-in list of standard libraries (e.g. the C math library).
This list of libraries is part of the
<A HREF="../m3build/m3build.html">m3build</A>
configuration.
The <B>-nostd</B> option stops the automatic addition of these libraries.
<P>

If the <B>-Z</B> option has been specified,
an object that collects and dumps the coverage tables
is added to the list of files to be linked.
The name of this object is part of the
<A HREF="../m3build/m3build.html">m3build</A>
configuration.
