<H2>Finding interfaces</H2>
<P>

The compiler locates the interface <I>Mumble</I> as follows: it
looks for a file named <I>Mumble.i3</I>
in the first directory on the search path.  If this file exists, the
compiler expects to find the interface within.  If the file does not
exist in the directory, the next one on the search path is examined,
and so on.  An error is given if the search path is exhausted before
the interface is found.
<P>

The compiler uses the same mechanism and search path to locate
generic interfaces and modules as it does to locate interfaces.
<P>

<B>m3</B> does not have a built-in default search path.  
The search path provided by
<A HREF="../m3build/m3build.html">m3build</A>
contains the standard SRC Modula-3 interfaces.
<P>
