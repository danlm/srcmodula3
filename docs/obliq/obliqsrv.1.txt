   Name
     Obliq Server - start an Obliq server


   Syntax
     oobblliiqqssrrvv [options] &


   Description

     An Obliq server. The command obliqsrv -X, where "X" is "std" or "ui",
     starts netobjd on the local machine M, if needed, and exports an
     execution engine to it. From any machine M1 one can then issue the Obliq
     command net_importEngine("XObliqEngine","M")(p) to execute the procedure
     p on machine M, where "X" is either "std" or "ui". Here M must be an IP
     address, and p must be a procedure of one arguments. The argument given
     to p is the IP address of the server, as a string. The result of p is
     returned to machine M1.  Obliq servers are linked without a
     parser/printer.

     A server has the privileges of the account that starts it. Every client
     acquires the privileges of the server while running in the server.  A
     server is not an inherent security risk: a server's operating system and
     file system are not avaliable to clients, unless the server allows it.

     To start an Obliq server on another machine M2, issue the following
     command:

     rsh M2 exec obliqsrv [options] &
