This archive contains the Obliq sources.

Obliq is a lexically-scoped untyped language that supports distributed 
object-oriented computation. An Obliq computation may involve multiple 
threads of control within an address space, multiple address spaces 
on a machine, heterogeneous machines over a local network, and multiple 
networks over the Internet. Objects are local to a site, while computation 
can roam over the network. The distributed computation mechanism 
is based on Modula-3 Network Objects. 

* The documentation is in obliq/src/Doc.
  The main document is provided in ps and html formats. (The html version is 
  automatically generated and, therefore, rather crude.)
  A "quick-start" html document is enclosed (its links may be site-dependent).

* Examples of Obliq programs are in obliq/src/Doc/Example.

* You will need a binary for "netobjd", the network object daemon, in order
  to use Obliq's network objects. (But this is not otherwise necessary.)
  Netobjd is part of the network objects distribution.

* You should build and ship the components of this archive in the
  following order:

      synloc, synex, metasyn, obliqrt,
      obliqlibm3, obliqlibui, obliqlibanim,
      obliqparse, obliqprint, obliq
      obliqbinmin, obliqbinstd, obliqbinui, obliqbinanim
      obliqsrvstd, obliqsrvui

  You can use the provided "obliq.builder" script.

  You should also copy the entire obliq/src/Doc/* to an http accessible 
  directory <dir>/, using <dir>/Obliq.html as the Mosaic entry point to 
  the Obliq documentation. The links in Obliq.html work if the structure of 
  obliq/src/Doc is maintained.
