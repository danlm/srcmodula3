(* Obliq's version of "eval", to evaluate a string containing obliq source. 
   This technique could be used by an application that has an Obliq runtime 
   linked-in without parser/printer. It is not very flexible, though because
   this eval does not take an evaluation environment, and it returns
   a string that is probably junk. *)

let eval =
  proc(command)
    wr_putText(wr_stdout,
      process_filter(processor, ["/proj/mips/bin/obliq"], command & ";\n"));
